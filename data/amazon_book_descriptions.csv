Wuthering Heights (AmazonClassics Edition),"Raised together on the Yorkshire moors, Heathcliff and Catherine become lovers and soul mates so utterly inseparable that their destiny seems inevitable. But when Catherine’s desire for social status results in her marriage to Heathcliff’s wealthy rival, Heathcliff is consumed by revenge. And no one in his path will be spared.
Admired for its stark originality and condemned for its fiendish affront to the senses, Wuthering Heights polarized critics. For generations of readers since, its themes of gender inequality, religious hypocrisy, social climbing, and the violent extremes of romantic obsession resonate to this day.
Revised edition: Previously published as Wuthering Heights, this edition of Wuthering Heights (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Readers either love or hate Wuthering Heights with a passion but under no circumstance are they indifferent and there is a reason for that. This book is a too powerful force of nature that devours the reader and does not let they leave. Many hate to be dragged like that. I'm among those who love it, and here are three reasons why:

First, I was overwhelmed by the intricate structure of the narrative, which flashes back and forward and intertwines several layers of narrators, from the ostensive Lockwood, to the fantastic voice of Nelly Dean, and then in another layer to what Nelly heard and read from Heathcliff, Isabella and Zillah. Emily Brontë manages to transition from one voice to the next smoothly and seamlessly, while sustaining a cohesive and consistent narrative that, for the length of time it covers, moves really fast. Indeed, I was amazed with how well she cuts any 'shoe leather' (there is particularly one transition, from the moors to inside Heathcliff's house in Chapter 27 that made me wow.) Nelly is a formidable storyteller if not a film editor, not only for what she tells and comments but also for what she disregards or conveniently excludes altogether. Some people say there are unnecessary characters, Lockwood being the most notorious one. But to me, having Lockwood to open room for Nelly is as clever as using Ellis Bell as a pen name, because with that Emily Brontë not only circumvented the prejudice against women authors in the Victorian Society but managed to tell a story in which a housekeeper has a lot to say and do. And imho this device also serves the plot well, because Lockwood's interest on Catherine adds to his unreliability (while he seems to let Nelly's voice reverberate untouched) as much as Nelly's own subtle influence on the destinies of the Earnshaws and Lintons goes unnoticed.

Second, there is a formidable storytelling that is both dark, cold and gloomy but also bright, warm, tender and beautiful, and this balance is so well put that readers can either see the novel as a romantic love story or a horror tale of violence and hatred. There are many duplicates and characters are also multifaceted. Most readers detest all characters because of their arrogant, selfish and even violent behavior but, in my view, they are tremendously rich of vulnerability and ambiguity. There is no one to clearly root for but at least to me it was difficult to hate them either. I may be a too indulgent kind of reader, but I felt WH was like Shyamalan's Servant where characters are mostly dislikeable but you just can't let them go. They are a too interesting pack of people to be forsaken. Virginia Woolf describes these characters as impossible in the real world, but yet captivating, which she attributes to Emily's rarest of all powers in a poet: ""She could free life from its dependence on facts; with a few touches indicate the spirit of a face so that it needs no body."" These characters are not real people, but they feel like people you know all the same.

Third, there is the supernatural. From the first scene when Lockwood meets Heathcliff, it became clear that Emily Brontë was no Jane Austen. Indeed, I began WH imagining Heathcliff as a kind of Servant's Uncle George in his natural habitat, rude and rough but tough and disciplined. Then there is the dreamlike haunting scene in Catherine's room (what was that, Kate Bush?) and the creepy, supernatural atmosphere never leaves completely anymore. The second half of the book that covers the second generation was so suffocating that I kept asking myself, as indeed I did in Servant, ""why didn't these people escape the evil influence of Heathcliff and go live their lives peacefully elsewhere?"" Like Leanne Grayson in Servant, Heathcliff's ability to take control of people seems superhuman, it transcends. Some scholars even see Heathcliff as a demonic figure in the Miltonian tradition of Frankenstein.

I didn't know before finishing WH that the Brontë Sisters were not from upper classes in England and wrote their books from their reclusive lives in the far lands of Yorkshire (that made me admire the power of Emily's ideas even more.) Inspiration certainly came from her readings, and I can see Hamlet and Macbeth in WH, while its creepy conclusion goes along with Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame (and now I think, Heathcliff a gypsy just like Esmeralda!). Harold Bloom recognizes Lord Byron, and other scholars explore the hidden parallels of WH with John Milton's Paradise Lost. Richard Ellman mentions that James Joyce once said to Eugene Jolas, while reading WH: ""This woman had pure imagination; Kipling had it too, and certainly Yeats."" That is more or less how I felt when finishing WH: Emily Brontë's imagination is powerful and irresistible as is her language and style, even when she goes over the top. WH is a force of nature that is futile to resist, it engulfs you with its hyperbolic style, cruel and violent characters, and bleaky and foggy atmosphere. In my case, it took me completely and does not seem to let me go anytime soon. I am a student in high school who is 17 years old, a product of the modern generation, and being forced to read this book for my AP English Literature class. Going into it, of course I knew of its reputation. But I also knew of its size. And at the same time, one can't help but think how a Victorian Era woman could cross time and gender conflict to get in touch with a 17 year old guy.

Boy, was I wrong.

Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte is a book to get lost in. The multi-layered, time jumping story absorbs the reader quickly and effortlessly, and doesn't let go until long after one's stay in the English countryside. A lot of the characters in this book are bad people, but none of them are bad characters. From powerful, crystal clear motives to mystery and revenge, Wuthering Heights has it all. And it's not going anywhere, so you might as well hop on the bandwagon and read it.

For those of you not in the know, Wuthering Heights is centered around a man named Heathcliff, who rents a house to a certain Mr. Lockwood early on in the book. Lockwood, our narrator, is shocked by some of the conditions Heathcliff is living in, and then asks his maid, Nelly, about it. Lockwood transcribes Nelly's words, creating two narrators.

At one point in the novel, Lockwood is writing down Nelly's words about Isabella reading Heathcliff's letter. That's four narrator's at once. Oh. My. Gosh. But don't you worry. Emily Bronte is no lightweight, and she can manage each and every character and story thread. I've touched upon this once and will continue with it for a while: there's a reason this book is a classic and so widely read.

On top of the plot, which is all consuming and entertaining (It's almost like , , or some other fantasy novel the way it creates its own world), there is this fierce underlying theme of love. But what's so great about this books theme is that its not a thesis statement. This book is a discussion of love, what it can do to man, what it creates, what it destroys. You'll find more academic truth in this novel about man's condition than you ever will in ay bare bones medical text book.

The strongest point in this book is the characters. Isabella, Linton, Heathcliff, Catherine ( A woman after my own heart), and many, many more stick with you for a long time. Nelly, especially, who isn't just a lame narrator. She truly brings some stuff to the table, and I've known a lot of people like her, so I have a soft spot for her in my heart.

It's hard to write a review of this novel because it's literally just so good. And that sounds cheesy, because its a classic and if you're here, you know its supposed to be good. But I cannot stress enough how this one not only lives up to, but it exceeds expectations for how good its supposed ot be. Don't pass this up. O livro é divino. Comprei para aprimorar a leitura na lingua inglesa e não me decepcionei. Entrega rápida. Farklı kapak geldi, onun dışında her zamanki Oxford Classics The delivery was fast and the book came in good condition. I really love this edition, it’s even more beautiful irl. Heard all about this book. It's taking me a long time to read. Old English takes time to understand. Not long to go now. Absolutely beautiful! 😱🤩"

Revised edition: Previously published as Pride and Prejudice, this edition of Pride and Prejudice (AmazonClassics Edition) Edition Review:
The Chiltern classics are classy, collectible, and most definitely giftable. Each copy is a work of art in the gorgeous raised cover art, gilt-edged pages, thick paper stock, ribbon bookmark, and well formatted pages and font. Just above the size of a paperback and comfort-cushioned hardbound feel in hand. Readers will love this edition.

Book Thoughts:
The Bennets of Longbourn are a frolicking family of five daughters, a bookish father and a fluttery mother. A young man of fortune moves to the neighborhood and all the matchmaking mamas are on point with Mrs. Bennet leading the way especially when he is joined by a friend of even more wealth and status.
Too bad, the imminently handsome and wealthy Mr. Darcy makes a terrible first impression and his struggles to deny his attraction for second Bennet daughter Lizzy are dismal and he slips in love with a woman who is unlike any he has ever before encountered.
Of course, there are other iconic characters and they invariably do their best to throw a spanner in the works for Darcy and Lizzy.
But, a few fortunate twists of fate and the generosity of Lizzy's Gardiner relations give them another chance if youngest Bennet daughter Lydia's escapades don't scotch it all for good.

Each time I read or listen, something different captures my attention. With this time around, it was eldest and beautiful tranquil Jane and also Mr. Bennet father to five grown daughters and husband to a woman of simple mind and purpose with an overwrought set of nerves.
After reading the dialogue between Jane and Lizzy discussing Wickham's 'woes' and Darcy's perfidies, I was never more struck by just how intensely determined Lizzy was in her prejudices. Gentle Jane made good sense in her observations and advice even if her own tranquil nature and boisterous relations messed up her own romance, but Lizzy was determined to think her quicker, livelier mind was superior to her sister's when it came to knowing people.
Then there was Mr. Bennet. I get a kick out of those opening pages each time when he enjoys teasing his wife and girls about Mr. Bingley when he secretly went and introduced himself so the family had a chance of meeting him at the neighborhood social gatherings, but he pretended to not have bothered. I think he was a lousy parent in many ways, but he is a comic addition to scenes several times. So droll!

All in all, another delightful outing with a favorite classic. ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.""

That's probably one of the most famous opening sentences of a novel, along with Moby Dick. Pride and Prejudice is also probably one of Jane Austen's most famous novels. I certainly liked it much more than Northanger Abbey. It is the story of Elizabeth Bennet, who lives with five sisters, and an odd pair of parents at Longbourn. Her mother is constantly scheming about marrying off her daughters to wealthy young men, so when Netherfield Park is let to the rich Mr. Bingley, she is very excited indeed. (Mr. Bennet's estate will be entailed away from the immediate family upon his death, so at least one of the sisters has to marry well to provide for them.) And Mr. Bingley brings his very proud friend, Mr. Darcy. The book is about the courtships, and, of course, has many twists and turns. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Wickham, and I suppose, the detestable Mr. Collins (who the estate will be entailed to) are the main men of the story.

I really loved this one; it had humor and wit in it, and great characters. I enjoyed Mr. Bennet and his sarcasm very much, though Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are really too silly sometimes. So stupid. And of course, Elizabeth. She is really a very smart and spirited young woman, who will not be ordered around. I also watched the 1995 TV series from BBC, and I must confess, Mr. Darcy...never mind.

Anyway, all the characters were well portrayed, and while the TV series is wonderful, it doesn't quite have the subtlety of the conversations in Pride and Prejudice itself. The TV series did have excellent casting though; all the Bennets, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Collins were portrayed very well. (Yes, I suppose this is sort of a double review.) I would say though, that Caroline Bingley should have been a little prettier; she was just hideous, and Mr. Bingley was kind of silly-looking. But everywhere else, they did very well.

Back to the book. As I said, there were many twists and turns which made this one a thoroughly enjoyable read. And really great characters. Though she is certainly less descriptive and florid than Dickens, Austen still manages in this one, to portray everyone extremely well. Mr. Collins really is detestable, Bingley overly-cheerful and positive, and Darcy stiff and stern (though he has his reasons, of course.) Mrs. Bennet is an extremely foolish woman, as is Lydia, the youngest Bennet. The pride and prejudice of the story refer, I believe, to Mr. Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice (though it is certainly debatable.) Mr. Darcy is very proud indeed at the beginning of the story, and Elizabeth's prejudice prevents her from seeing his true character for a while.

I will just add that I read the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition from 2009, and while it has a very nice design, it does not have any analysis or introduction, so if you want that you'd be better off reading the Penguin Classics regular edition or Oxford World Classics. However, my Penguin Classics Deluxe edition arrived slightly damaged on the spine, which was a disappointment.

[...] I listened to the audible version of this - it was narrated by Rosamund Pike, who of course plays Jane in the cinematic version of this book. Loved the narration! I have seen the film several times, and I appreciated that they stayed very close to the original work. It’s absolutely beautiful and came in pristine condition. Pride and Prejudice, in its enchanting and beautifully designed edition, is an absolute gem that belongs in every book lover's collection. The elegance of this version, aptly titled Gift Classics, is apparent from the moment you lay eyes upon it.

This book is a literary masterpiece by Jane Austen, and Gift Classics has paid homage to its brilliance with a stunning cover art, reminiscent of the Regency era in which the story is set. The detailing, embossed gold lettering, and carefully chosen font create an unparalleled aesthetic that instantly captivates.

Beyond its visual appeal, this edition of Pride and Prejudice proudly upholds the essence of Austen's work. The pages are of exceptional quality, thick and crisp, ensuring a smooth reading experience. The font is well-sized and easy on the eyes, allowing readers to immerse themselves in the world of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy without any distractions.

One delightful aspect of this edition is the inclusion of insightful annotations and footnotes, which shed light on the era, language, and historical context woven into the story. These explanations enrich the reading experience, making the dialogue and societal norms of Austen's time more accessible and relatable.

Gift Classics' meticulous attention to detail extends to the binding, which is sturdy and built to last. This is a book that can withstand multiple readings, a true heirloom to be passed down through generations.

As a classic that has been adapted countless times into various media forms, Pride and Prejudice continues to captivate and enchant readers with its timeless characters and the exploration of love, identity, and class divisions. Gift Classics has truly done justice to this beloved novel, presenting it with utmost respect and care.

Whether you are a devoted Austen fan or a newcomer to her works, Pride and Prejudice (Gift Classics) is a treasure that will adorn your bookshelf and provide endless joy in revisiting or discovering Jane Austen's world. This book is just absolutely splendid. It is a real tour de force, a master piece, a Magnus opus, a Diamond of a book. It is my opinion that this book should be read by everyone.
There is so much to learn and enjoy in this book. Austen is an absolute master at writing human nature into characters on a page, this book is so chock full of insights into and lesson about the human nature it’s myriad follies, foibles, strength, weaknesses, proclivities, varieties, permutation, and evolution that it is almost double the worth of any anthropology textbook.
Austen understands people, who they are, how they act, and what makes them tick, and she writes with this masterful understanding, the result are characters that are real, real in the sense that they very much reflect what people in real life really are and teaches in a way the most expert of lectures on anthropology simply couldn’t not ever dream of doing.

Eu me considero agraciado pelo fato de ter tantos livros bons para ler nesse mundo e eu poder ler essa beleza que é Orgulho e Preconceito. Há bastante tempo ouço falar desse livro e de Jane Austen pela Cecília ❤️ do podcast 30 minutos. Mas muitas coisas aconteceram e cheguei a ler o livro só agora. E que ótima escolha foi isso. Elizabeth é uma personagem fascinante pela sua forma de se expressar e pensar e foi muito engraçado ver como Mr. Darcy foi aparecendo para nós, inicialmente com todo o orgulho que ele tinha até o ponto em que ele está pedindo desculpas para Lizzy. Esta é uma das minhas leituras favoritas desse ano que ainda tem muitos meses pela frente. Très beau comme sur la photo."
Dracula (AmazonClassics Edition),"Young lawyer Jonathan Harker journeys to Transylvania to meet with the mysterious Count Dracula only to discover that his nobleman client is a vampire who is thirsty for new blood. After imprisoning Harker in his castle, Dracula travels to England to seduce Jonathan’s fiancée, Mina, and the battle against an ineffable evil begins.
Led by philosopher and metaphysician Professor Van Helsing—Dracula’s most indomitable adversary—Harker, Mina, and a band of allies unite, determined to confront and destroy the Count before he can escape.
Bram Stoker ingeniously modernized gothic folklore by moving his vampire from traditional castle ruins to modern England. With Dracula, which has been interpreted and dissected by scholars for generations, Stoker changed the vampire novel forever.
Revised edition: Previously published as Dracula, this edition of Dracula (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. KindleUnlimited review. Highly recommend anyone who heard of or watched a Dracula film read this novel. Written in the style of a synchronous diary (i.e., epistolary format), the original Dracula story is a gothic Victorian horror novel containing several variations from the numerous screen adaptations.

Each early chapter is entitled “Jonathan’s Harkin’s Journal” and starting with “3 May. Bistritz” is similarly dated with the day and month with occasionally the time. Starting in Chapter 5 the narration expands to include person correspondence between Mina Murray & Lucy Westenra and Quincy Morris & Arthur Holmwood as well as a diary entry from Dr. John Seward. Chapter 6 includes Mina’s journal entries from to 24 July to 6 August and Dr. Seward’s diary entry from 5 June to 20 July. This unique narrative approach continues and expands throughout all 27 chapters (last dated entry 6 November) providing a multifaceted and rich world with an account of events from different character perspectives. As a side note, chapter 25 provides a physiological profile of Count Dracula commensurate with a crime scene investigation procedural program.

I think the most interesting character not present in film adaptations is Quincy Morris, a noble American Cowboy brandishing Winchester repeating weapons. Although the love quad-angle between Lucy and three of the men (Morris, Seward, and Holmwood) appears farcical when first presented, it established the prior relationship between the men and why no animosity developed between the them after wards. Furthermore, the manly friends have participated in animal hunts where Morris the American was the director and guide.

Another apparent anachronism is how wealth us in itself a virtue: “And, too, it made me think of the wonderful power of money! What can it not do when it is properly applied; and what might it do when basely used! I felt so thankful that Lord Godalming is rich, and that both he and Mr. Morris, who also has plenty of money, are willing to spend it so freely. For if they did not, our little expedition could not start, either so promptly or so well equipped, as it will within another hour.” Some may argue that this viewpoint is still prevalent is modern society… ergo economic might makes right.

Although the novel was published in 1897, the year is omitted but presumed to be contemporary to the 1890s. Most notably is detailed description of Count Dracula: “His face was a strong—a very strong—aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor… I had noticed the backs of his hands… seemed rather white and fine… rather coarse—broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in the center of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp point… his breath was rank…”

An odd dissimilarity is the locomotion of how Dracula traverses the castle’s exterior “just as a lizard moves along a wall” whereas in many movies he changes into a flying bat. Later he does travel as a bat, a wolf, fog, and a puff of smoke. Another story difference is Dracula’s ability to call and direct large packs of wolves. He clearly commands the wolves, rats, and spiders as he does any person under his vampiric spell.

The story unfolds as a mystery. It’s not until the end of Chapter 14 that Professor Abraham Van Helsing reveals what actually happened to Miss Lucy. There are curious mentions in Stoker’s “Dracula” (1897) novel that make it seem more contemporary. Characters anonymously traverse London in Hansom cabs much like people take an Uber ride today. The party travelled from Paris to Varna via the Orient Express which predates the eponymous “Murder on the Orient Express” (1934) by Agatha Christie. Characters dispatch letters and telegrams like modern society send emails and text messages. Mina prepares typed pages of chronology organized journal entries with her traveler’s typewriter like printing on a modern computer. Similarly, Doctor Seward’s penchant to record his diary instead of writing had the character quip “How I miss my phonograph! To write diary with a pen is irksome to me; but Van Helsing says I must.”

There is the typical Victorian ethnocentric view of other cultures. For instance, when discussing killing Count Dracula in Transylvania the author stated “We think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen. Thank God! this is the country where bribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with money. We have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned, and we shall be safe. Judge Moneybag will settle this case, I think!”

As usually the case, Raeford Renfeild’s and Dr. Van Helsing characters are more fully explored in the novel than it’s film counterparts. Renfield is possessed by Dracula much like Gollum in Lord of the Rings and is truly a pitiful character. Whereas, Van Helsing (both an experienced medical doctor, educator, and lawyer) is intelligent, brave, and sincere - a true friend. Similarly, many know that Dracula preying upon the neck of his victims is an allegory for sexual assault. However, the end of Chapter 21 and beginning of Chapter 22 details Dracula’s attack on Mina Harken leaves no doubt to the correlation. The Count’s backstory is summarized as “… he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman, and alchemist… He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse... and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay.“ The Oxford World's Classics DRACULA edited by Roger Luckhurst has the best introduction and the best notes to DRACULA I've ever seen. It outclasses THE ESSENTIAL DRACULA, whose notes push the reader around one way or another. It explains more and it also, wisely, keeps quiet more, letting the book weave its own spell.

The introduction shows how DRACULA is a wonderful mix of almost every kind of evil the Victorian English could think of. The vampire has evil features from anti-Catholic prejudice, from anti-Semitic prejudice, from prejudice against Islam, Middle Europe, the unscientific past -- about the only un-English thing that gets a good word is garlic. As the introducer points out, Dracula is in part based on the ""real"" Dracula, Vlad the Impaler, but is also based on so many other evil rulers and monsters, real and fictional, that no single source for our monster can be cited or believed in.

In other words, Stoker got together a lot of reference works and then made Dracula up, and what a stunning, wonderful job he did.

The Luckhurst Oxford World Classics edition is available on Kindle for a small price that's well worth its wonderful notes and analysis. Amazon, in its curiously mysterious way, will not show you the book if you just type in DRACULA. You have to type in something like DRACULA OXFORD instead, and I very much suggest you do that. Doing without notes of one kind or another seems out of the question to me. There are passages in a messed-up seaside-town dialect Stoker made up from a reference book, and I contend NO ONE can read these passages without notes. Luckhurst also fits all the superstitions together, to the degree that Stoker lets him, and I think you need that kind of help too.

As for Stoker's DRACULA itself, it came across to me in this reading better than it ever had before. I'd read it two or three times in the past, but I'd been overexposed to NOSFERATU and the Lugosi movie, so I misremembered the book, made it cruder in my recollection than it actually was. Two main points I had forgotten (I'm afraid deep DRACULA readers won't think much of me after these admissions -- and watch out, because some of them are mild S-P-O-I-L-E-R-S):

1) Jonathan Harker, Dracula's helpless victim throughout the first fifth of the book, not only survives but gets a pat on the back for his manliness from the rest of the novel's many heroes. That was a relief, and unified the book for me. You can't keep a good man down.

2) Renfield, the crazy guy who eats flies and spiders, is a good reasoner from a high social class (Luckhurst's annotations make this quite clear, and the way Renfield talks tells the reader the same thing). In movie versions, he's creepy and that's about it. In the novel, he's a philosopher, and some of the most important points about vampire philosophy in general come to us from him.

Put these two things together, and the book comes out more intelligent than I remembered, and less pure senseless horror. As pure senseless horror it's just a bit silly. The intelligence and strength of Harker and Renfield save it from that silliness.

Lots of people who don't like the book point out that the opening section, where Harker and Dracula face off against one another, is as horrifying as anybody who likes nineteenth century thrillers could possibly want ... but then the book seems to go soft suddenly, focusing on a shallow woman and seeming, for quite a while, like a dull romance novel.

Luckhurst's notes, again, helped me get over this impression of slowdown. The nature of manliness and womanliness is tremendously important to Stoker's world-view. As Luckhurst points out, all the novel's manly men break down at one point or another, and are braced up by their need to care for weak, helpless women. All the clichés about masculinity and femininity are dragged out -- and all of them are subverted in the most interesting, and horrifying, possible way.

Mina, for example, is a strong, capable woman. Furthermore, she's practically indispensable to the vampire-hunt. The tough doctor, Seward, keeps a diary on phonograph cylinders. He's totally up-to-date, but he forgets even to write a summary of what the cylinders are about, so he can't find anything he told his recorded diary! All he can do is paw helplessly through a drawer full of phonograph cylinders. Mina types them up for him, so that at last the good guys can start tracking Dracula down.

But the good guys' decision to keep her out of the rest of their activities, and inform her of nothing as they start sharpening their stakes, makes her immediately fall into Dracula's clutches.

In other words, if only they trusted women more, their women wouldn't get hurt so much.

Stranger than Dracula himself. But the book has lots of this kind of strangeness. We find out what vampires are bit by bit and bite by bite, but when we're all done, strangely enough, we still don't know what we've really been dealing with: a middle-European monster, or our own monstrous views of how life should go.

I never had more fun than with this DRACULA. I've wanted to buy ""Dracula"" by Bram Stoker for years, but it wasn't until I found this edition that I actually did it. It's a lovely, luxurious feeling to the entire book, but I have to agree with others: the print is fairly small and a little hard to read and therefore I give this book one star less than the maximum. Great read. Oh my god! I freakin love the book, so cool and so good to read, i eyes were glued and every second i was Thinking ' whats happening next now? ' amazing book for horror lovers as i am ❤❤❤ Considero essa leitura superior ao filme, é uma leitura rápida e dinâmica, um livro curto porém interessante. Este libro es fascinante. Lo recomiendo a todo el mundo sin importar cuales sean tus gustos de lectura. Me ha encantado, desde el principio capta tu atencion y la mantiene hasta el final. Un clasico esencial."
The Picture of Dorian Gray (AmazonClassics Edition),"In the wealthy and vain hedonist Dorian Gray, London painter Basil Hallward has found his muse. Only when the portrait of Dorian begins to age, while the man himself remains untouched by time, do they realize they may have made a deal with the devil.
Oscar Wilde’s only novel takes a witty, philosophical, and harrowing look at our obsession with youth and the price we pay for it.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Picture of Dorian Gray, this edition of The Picture of Dorian Gray (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Overview
The Picture of Dorian Gray is a gothic novel written by Oscar Wilde and first published in April 1890.

The book opens on with painter, Basil Hallward, a sensitive soul, painting a portrait of a young man of extraordinary good looks called Dorian Gray. Basil’s friend, Lord Henry Wotton is observing Basil adding the final touches to the painting and comments that it is Basil’s best work.

Lord Henry takes an interest in Dorian, a remarkably good looking but shallow young man, and sets about influencing him with his believes that beauty and the pursuit of personal pleasure are the only things in life worth pursuing.

Basil gifts the painting to Dorian who makes a secret wish that the painting could age and change on his behalf and that he, Dorian, could retain his good looks for the rest of his life.

Under the warped influence of Lord Henry, Dorian sets out to explore every emotion and sensation life has to offer, regardless of the cost to others. He meets a beautiful young actress, Sybil Vane, and falls in love with her amazing renditions of the various heroines in Shakespeare’s plays, in particularly the tragic roles. He purposefully meets Sybil and declares his love for her. A young and easily influenced girl from a poor family, Sybil falls in love with Dorian, and it impacts on her acting, rendering her quite unable to perform. Dorian rejects her and Sybil commits suicide in her anguish. After this tragedy, Dorian views the painting and see a sneer of cruelty around the portrait’s mouth. He realises that his wish for eternal youth and beauty has come true.

Influenced by a book provided by Lord Henry, Dorian sets out on a path of debauchery and sin, influencing other young men and women to accompany him in his heinous behaviours. As his life progresses, the painting becomes more and more hideous.

The quote below describes the degeneration of Dorian’s soul as depicted by the painting:

“Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul. He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.

There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were rare. That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase with gratification. The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.”

Characterisations
The introductory chapters to this book set the stage for the plot extremely well as it gives a lot of insight into the characters of the three men at that point in time.

Basil is clearly sensitive and creative, an excellent artist and a lover of beauty. Dorian’s angelic looks have captivated him to a point where he is obsessed by the concept and illusion of this young man he has created in his own mind. His painting of Dorian is his attempt to capture the beauty and goodness he believes he perceives in his subject. Basil is delighted by the painting which he believes does justice to the characteristics he has attributed to Dorian.

Basil is also a man of strong morals and principles. All his characteristics are demonstrated by the following quote:

“You don’t understand me, Harry,” answered the artist. “Of course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth. There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one’s fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat. They live as we all should live–undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands. Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are–my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray’s good looks–we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.”

Lord Henry Wotton is a self-centred and egotistical man. Spoiled due to his life of wealth, privilege and idleness, Lord Henry proclaims himself to be a hedonist who believes the pursuit of personal pleasure is the most important thing in life. He is a clever man who has channelled his brilliant mind into devising fascinating, poisonous and ill-conceived theories to support his shallow and selfish beliefs. Despite his long ramblings in support of his ridiculous notions about life, he is not actually a bad man and does not indulge in sordid or criminal behaviour. In fact, he believes that criminal activity belongs exclusively in the realm of those he deems to be the lower orders of humanity.

Unfortunately, Lord Henry is charming and worldly in addition to being a great, albeit misguided, intellect and he easily influences the weak and spineless Dorian Gray with his radical theories.

The following quote is an example of one of Lord Henry’s speeches:

““There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral – immoral from the scientific point of view.”

“Why?”

“Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of someone else’s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly – that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s self. Of course they are charitable. They feed the hungry, and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion – these are the two things that govern us. And yet […] I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream – I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all maladies of medievalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal – to something finer, richer, than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. […] We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind, and poisons us. … The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.””

Dorian Gray is a weak character with not ambition to do anything useful with his life. The reader quickly realises that Basil’s romantic ideas about the young man are mere fancies, and that Dorian is not actually a very nice person. He is aware of his beauty right from the beginning of the book, and is very vain, but he is not aware of its lack of durability. It is Lord Henry who draws Dorian’s attention to the fact that beauty and youth are short lived.

Consider this quote:

“The painter considered for a few moments. “He likes me,” he answered after a pause; “I know he likes me. Of course I flatter him dreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that I know I shall be sorry for having said. As a rule, he is charming to me, and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain. Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat, a bit of decoration to charm his vanity, an ornament for a summer’s day.””

Is The Picture of Dorian Gray worth reading?
The painting in this story, effectively depicts Dorian’s soul or true self. As Dorian sinks deeper and deeper into a life of debauchery and sin, the effects of his actions show on the portrait making it uglier and uglier. For me, the effect of sin on the painting is an effective metaphor for the effect of selfishness and I-concentric behaviour on our own souls.

In our modern world of excessive consumption, I think this lesson is still vitally important. Mankind needs to look beyond individual wants and desires and set about earnestly saving our wildlife and natural environment as well as uplifting and education disadvantaged people.

In addition, from my personal perspective, I loved the skillful and beautiful writing (although it does require extra concentration effort as the descriptive paragraphs are long and intricate) and an interesting storyline in addition to its focus on questionable ideals that still dominate our society. I’ve seen the film version of The Picture of Dorian Gray twice now and really enjoyed it so I figured I’d read the source material. Oscar Wilde, poet and playwright, is not known for his prose. This was actually printed initially in 1890 in a literary magazine before Wilde added some to it and published it as a novel a year later.

Dorian Gray is a handsome young man who sits for a painting session by Basil Hallward. The artist is clearly infatuated by Gray and though the homosexual tendencies in the novel are latent they are discernible. Wilde was himself a gay man. He led a tortured life in Victorian England and even served time for “gross indecency for homosexual acts” so the modern reader can understand why he tamped down the gay stuff.

When Hallward is done with the painting, his friend Lord Henry Wotton comments to Gray that he will come to despise this portrait in the future because as he ages and loses his youthful appearance, the painting will forever remind him of how glorious he once looked. Gray says a prayer that the opposite will happen, that the painting will wither and age while he will be forever young.

His prayer is answered.

When a woman Gray breaks up with kills herself he spirals out of control, becoming self absorbed and reckless, visiting opium dens and seedy dance halls. Years go by and he retains his youthful looks while the image of him in the painting, which he has stored away in a locked room, not only ages but becomes grotesque as it portrays his wicked ways. When Hallward insists on seeing the painting again, Gray murders him. In the final scene Gray decides to destroy the painting to regain his soul, slashing it with a knife. I’ll leave out what happens next so as not to spoil everything.

The story itself is intriguing but the real attraction is the humorous and insightful Lord Henry Wotton. Wilde uses him as a literary device to sprinkle in such epigrams as “There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about” and “The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it” and my favorite: “To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.” Wotton is one of those rare characters in a book who’s so dynamic the story suffers when he’s not in a scene.

I gave this 4 out of 5 stars. The novel lags a little in the second act and the prose can be a bit challenging as many books written over a century ago can be. But overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who’d like to read a “classic” psychological thriller. tutto ok! I love Collectors Library books. They are perfect small size for travel, come with a bookmark and the pages have lovely gold edges Boyut olarak normal kitaplardan biraz daha ufak ama yazıları okuması kolay ve kargolama başarılıydı وش ذا طلبت مرتين وبالمرتين كله جاني والكوڤر حقه عليه علامات تعفيط Undoubtedly the best novel written by Oscar Wilde... Storyline is quite attractive, and you will find many profound comments concerning such as love, art, life,etc.
Readers should keep in mind that Lord Henry (intimate friend of Dorian Gray ) is the 'shadow main character' of this story."
War and Peace (AmazonClassics Edition),"In early nineteenth-century Russia, the threat of Napoleon’s invasion looms, and the lives of millions are about to be changed forever. This includes Pierre Bezúkhov, illegitimate son of an aristocrat; Andrew Bolkónski, ambitious military scion; and Natásha Rostóva, compassionate daughter of a nobleman. All of them are unprepared for what lies ahead. Alongside their fellow compatriots—a catalog of enduring literary characters—Pierre, Andrew, and Natásha will be irrevocably torn between fate and free will.
Through the bonds of love and family, and all that can break them, Tolstoy examines the effects of war on every strata of society in his masterwork of intimate—and epic—social history.
Revised edition: Previously published as War and Peace, this edition of War and Peace (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Although being a very long book to read, I liked it and learned a lot. I found Denisov’s rhotacism a charming trait and enjoyed his story line. The descriptions of Prince Andrews’ impending death experience were vivid and very well-written. The passage regarding the start Natasha’s healing resonated with me: “…the layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed impenetrable, delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting…”

I learned a lot about the art of war and expectations or rules versus what actually occurred. Morale plays such an important role in determining who reigns supreme. Having hindsight can teach us a lot but it is also clouded by interpretation and POV.

I’ve read a lot about Russian history, but the book has rekindled my interest in learning more, along with wanting to learn more about Bonaparte and the French Revolution. I can’t count the number of times I tried to read War and Peace over my lifetime, each time giving up in under forty pages, entirely confused by who people were, and the context in which they were living. But finally, all because of the Covid-19 need to shelter in place for people in their 80s and personally susceptible to lung infections, I read the book in its entirety. I am entirely wowed by it.

Reading it in a small group of three—five chapters a day accompanied by a daily 15-30 minute video-call/discussion—I have just finished this masterpiece. I was not prepared to be so blown away by such mastery of writing, although I knew the story was compelling. But over and over, I was amazed and wowed by how much Tolstoy could say in one or two sentences about a person or a situation.

Not knowing any nineteenth century Russian history, to speak of, the plot drove me to the internet dozens of times to look up a battle or an historic character that pepper the pages of this saga. The masterful intermingling of fictional characters who grow and change as a result of their experiences with historic movers and shakers is rich and thought provoking More than once (actually, probably about twenty times) my fellow readers and I noted stunning parallels to modern times. We are not alone in living with corruption in leaders. it was, at times, as if Tolstoy were directly speaking to us in the 21st century.

Yes, there are sections that are really tough to read, especially the second epilogue. I fell asleep several times plodding my way through that,but after making it all the way through its 1,500 pages, I wasn’t going to stop reading until every word of the book had been read! And I couldn’t be happier. Not only am I proud of myself of accomplishing this literary goal at age 80, but I bow in homage to it the author of this timeless masterpiece. This book was better than I thought. But, being honest, I was reading maybe 15 minutes a day and not making much progress for an 800 page book. I decided to give Audible a try and that did the trick. I would agree that this is a masterpiece. At first, I thought this was going to be an 1800s version of a soap opera. As I got into it, I found the characters relatable and believable. His use of metaphors was fantastic. I particularly enjoyed Andrew's comparison of war to a game of chess. I did not care for the second epilogue - too complex for me! “Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.” – Soren Kierkegaard

No trains, planes or automobiles; no steam engines (until 1817), no morphine, penicillin, sterile environments; no phones, no cell phones, no telegraph, no electric light; no photography; but about 50 years before our American Civil War, Darwin’s On the Origin of Species.

War and Peace is not a pure novel. It is a conglomerate of an epic story of Russian families during the height of the Napoleonic Wars and a philosophical discourse. But most is a romantic story. It has such rich character building prose that one cannot succumb to feeling for these characters and knowing these characters and how and why they reacted and behaved as they did from 1805 to 1820.

One grows to dislike a character and later one finds oneself surprised to admire him, seeing him in a new light. For me, I must admit, I was teary eyed during some scenes, especially when I sensed an inevitable conclusion or something that I can’t really explain while I was reading it. And it wasn’t just someone’s inevitable death, but also an inevitable love.

Don’t deny yourself the pleasure of reading this page turner! There are 365 chapters in 15 Books and 2 epilogs. Each chapter is a “quick read”, Do the math, there are 957 pages in my Kindle version (translated by Maude Alymer; forward2.wordpress.com) Each chapter compels you to read the next. Tolstoy is quite a craftsman in this regard. This book has references to mental health, abuse, neglect, if you understand such things, it is very relevant in that it speaks of things happening now in the world. This is the Maude translation, which is (as I understand it) the definitive one. The translation has since been revised and updated, but not, I think, for Kindle. The most important difference is that the Maudes translated all the French into English, but without indicating that the characters are speaking French. Also missing: an introduction; a list of the enormous cast of characters with all of the variants of their names; helpful editorial apparatuses that explain things for the modern reader. For another $15-20 you can get the new Oxford edition in hardback, which revises this definitive translation by restoring the French (which it translates in the footnotes), and contains lots of useful information to boot. It's not as physically massive as I had feared! This edition might even make for a decent read-along for those moments when you want to remember where else you encountered a particular character. I suspect I will use it that way, now that I have the Oxford. Bonjour, j'ai acheté ce livre il y a quelques mois sur votre site et j'ai aussi acheté un kindle depuis. Je me rappelle qu'à l'achat une version gratuite sur kindle m'avait été proposé mais je n'en possédé pas encore un. Est-il possible d'avoir un code pour mettre ce livre sur mon kindle ? Désolée si j'emploie des nouveaux termes, ceci est tout nouveau pour moi :)

Bonne journée et merci d'avance.
Marie-Aude To add any words for this timeless classic would not do any justice. On a quest to understand life, this classic is a guiding companion. At times it feels like the apparent story is just a guise constructed to convey the deep philosophical currents from the author. Indescribable. Got thoroughly soaked in to the book... Me gusta muchísimo el produto y el contenido.
Simplemente no me gusta leer con palabras tan pequeñas. Creo que tendría sido mejor separar en dos volúmenes. I enjoyed it. Took me probably two weeks to read. There are shades of Jane Austen in the social scenes, the historical war accounts are engrossing and the philosophical tear-down at the end was heavy going but inspirational. Trabalho excelente nesta edição. Tive um problema durante a entrega, mas veio sem nenhum arranhão. Recomendo."
Frankenstein (AmazonClassics Edition),"Obsessed with the secret of creation, Swiss scientist Dr. Victor Frankenstein cobbles together a body he’s determined to bring to life. And one fateful night, he does. When the creature opens his eyes, the doctor is repulsed: his vision of perfection is, in fact, a hideous monster. Dr. Frankenstein abandons his creation, but the monster won’t be ignored, setting in motion a chain of violence and terror that shadows Victor to his death.
Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, a gripping story about the ethics of creation and the consequences of trauma, is one of the most influential Gothic novels in British literature. It is as relevant today as it is haunting.
Revised edition: Previously published as Frankenstein, this edition of Frankenstein (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Amazon groups reviews for the same story even when they are from different editions and in the case of Frankenstein the worst is that there are two similar but not identical versions. The first is the 1818 uncensored edition by e-artnow; the other is the AmazonClassics Edition, it doesn't say which version it is but after reading it is clear to me that it's the posterior 1823 edition. The 1818 edition is a bit more journalistic in the sense to show you the events and let you think your own conclusions, the 1823 edition is a bit more explicit in the moral judgment of the wretched Victor Frankenstein. But these differences are quite subtle... in my opinion it had been better if we just had the 1818 story, it's perfect. Both editions has X-Ray, about the differences I can say:

* AmazonClassics Edition (2 stars):
In the positive side the formatting is modern and professional, you can easily see that you are reading a letter for example; the typography is clean allowing you to read with more comfort. In the negative side is evil the lengths that AmazonClassics attempt to hide dates, there is no year of publication, which is a sin considering there are the two different versions from different years; the malign editor even hides the date that is in the preface, sobbing his hands in the excitement to draw the readers into the pit of despair.

* e-artnow edition (3 stars):
In the positive side it contains the pure text, it's a normal formatting, not excellent as the AmazonClassics but works, but it's more useful as it informs you about the edition used. I read it fast along the AmazonClassic so I didn't find errors but could not guarantee their non existence. In the negative side... I have no important observations, I don't like the cover, the cinema version doesn't correspond to the book.

In conclusion although the AmazonClassics edition is comfortable sadly it seems there is an attempt to hide the mentioned years. I cannot recommend it. The e-artnow edition is good enough, less comfortable to read but still has X-Ray and the mentioned years as the author intended them are present.

Taking aside the editorial aspect I loved a lot to read Frankenstein. Mary Shelley made, barely 20 years old, an awe-inspiring horror novel. In my opinion far more impacting than Stevenson's ""Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,"" with which it shares some characteristics. The creature, the creation of Victor Frankenstein, is human, he does terrible actions because he suffers, he has been abandoned by the man that donned life to him. Victor Frankenstein is the monster. Surrounded by persons that love him, even the creature could love him, he betrays them without compassion. He suffers but never for others but by the guilt of his lies being unleashed. Is crystalline that he only love physical beauty, Shelley is quite talented to make you feel like the witness of the mental struggle and physical stress of a dark hearted man.

If there is something that reveal both the youth of Mary Shelly and her culture devoid of life experience is the fact that her characters triumph or fail through the study of books rather than from work, knowledge and reality. I felt Europe quite small too, it seemed like either the each of the characters bought the seven-league boots or that Europe is as big as a thematic park. But these are minor details for a classic whose reading at least once could enrich you. Mary Shelley's timeless classic, Frankenstein, stands as a haunting testament to the human pursuit of knowledge and the consequences that accompany unchecked ambition. With its gripping narrative and profound exploration of moral and existential themes, this Gothic masterpiece continues to captivate readers even two centuries after its initial publication.

Set against the backdrop of a gloomy and desolate landscape, the story follows Victor Frankenstein, a young and ambitious scientist consumed by his desire to conquer death and unlock the secrets of life itself. Driven by his insatiable thirst for knowledge, Victor embarks on a perilous journey that leads him to create a being out of stolen body parts. Yet, this act of creation soon turns into a nightmare, as the creature awakens with a bewildered consciousness, abandoned by its creator and left to navigate a hostile world alone.

Shelley skillfully delves into the complex psyches of both Victor and his creature, exploring their parallel narratives and the consequences of their actions. Through Victor's internal struggle with guilt and remorse, Shelley exposes the moral ambiguity inherent in human nature, forcing readers to question the ethical implications of scientific advancement. The creature, often portrayed as a monster, is paradoxically both sympathetic and terrifying—a tortured soul seeking acceptance and love in a world that rejects him based on his outward appearance.

The novel's narrative structure, presented through a series of letters and firsthand accounts, enhances the sense of impending doom and creates a chilling atmosphere of suspense. Shelley's evocative prose paints vivid images, immersing the reader in a world of darkness and despair. Her exploration of the themes of abandonment, revenge, and the nature of humanity provokes profound introspection and challenges the boundaries of empathy.

Frankenstein stands as a cautionary tale, cautioning against the dangers of unchecked scientific progress and the moral responsibility that accompanies human creation. It serves as a timeless reminder that knowledge without wisdom and compassion can lead to disastrous consequences.

In conclusion, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is a remarkable work of literature that continues to resonate with readers today. Its exploration of human ambition, the moral implications of scientific advancement, and the search for identity and acceptance makes it a thought-provoking and unsettling read. With its beautifully crafted narrative and complex characters, Frankenstein remains a masterpiece that forces us to confront our own humanity and the ethical dilemmas that arise when playing with the forces of life and death. Muy cautivador el personaje de Frankenstein con todos sus matices. Lectura recomendable. Narrativa y vocabulario faciles de comprender aún cuando el inglés no es mi lengua materna. “Frankenstein has done more than any other story to define the anxieties of modern life. But it’s what it tells us about compassion that we need now more than ever.”, by Rebecca Lawrence (BBC Culture - June 13, 2018)

If you think that because you have watched the movie adaptations you can skip this book, then you don’t know what you are missing.
The movie obscured Shelley’s intentions.
This is not a horror book.
It’s a drama at its finest.
The writing is fascinating!
And if you add the audiobook narrated by Dan Stevens you will be transported to the era and be totally involved in the emotional rollercoaster.
The writing is complex and vivid and expresses the anguish of both monster and creator.

I thought the story was exceptionally well told and the writing definitely brought it to life.

What I enjoyed the most is that we have the monster’s perspective.

What an incredible imagination!

The author was 18 years old and this book was written in 1818, so take that into consideration.

What a great read! A great read. Very deep and emotional story that makes you wonder about the “evil” inside all of us. Coming from one of the most authentic authoress of the British Romantic Age, Mary Shelly's Frankenstein delves into the repercussions of thirst for knowledge. The plot starts with an epistle of Walton to his sister describing his sea voyage and the story of rescued man called Victor Frankenstein whose knowledge of Natural Philosophy and chemistry makes him a creator of a ""Daemon"". He relates his story of making this creature who turned his life upside-down. As unbiased as it is, Mary Shelley also gets into the mind and experience of the creature. Though of eight feet, the creature is a new born child who was abandoned without any speech and knowledge of the world. The creature suffers in the hands of the country people, even from the people he has called ""my protectors"". When disregarded and ill treated by the people he loved, he follows his creator to make a deal with him. But when Frankenstein, out of human instinct, didn't abide to his demand, the creature goes mad with rage and starts killing the people Frankenstein loves. Towards the end when Frankenstein dies in Walton's ship, the creature, having no more purpose of life, goes away.

From a reader's perspective, both the characters were well written and well developed. No one can be blamed for their endeavors. They have done what they thought would be the right thing to do. I have my sympathy for Victor Frankenstein but my heart cried for the creature. He has suffering having no fault of his own. The creature was more humane than humans. He has sympathy for everyone even though he has killed people out of sheer rage.

The theme of Alienation is so powerfully depicted through the experience of the creature. Even though written 150 years before the concept of existentialism and absurdism were developed, this novel is concerned with mid-20th Century world. Involuntarily, Mary Shelley has prophesied the future of the succeeding generation.

Undoubtedly this book has won over hearts all over the world and maintained its value and intensity for three centuries and will keep doing it for the centuries to come. The story is iconic for a reason, the emotion and depth of characters is second to none.

The movie Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994) is much closer to the original story that all the previous movies, but like most movies it pails in comparison to the book.

Unlike some of the other classics like Shakespeare, it can be read by anyone, you do not need a degree in literature to enjoy it."

Dashing young sailor Edmond Dantes is a honest young man whose peaceful life and plans to marry the beautiful Mercedes are abruptly shattered by Mercedes cousin Fernand who is in love with her and deceives them by telling the police Edmond was part of the Bonapartist party. This party supported Napoleon, a person who all of the Europe hated for taking all he wanted. Dantes was thrown into a jail and for trying to kill the person bringing him food, he was taken to the dungeons. 2 years later he met a another prisoner because that prisoner was trying to escape and dug a tunnel to Dantes cell. This man's name was Abbe Faria, one of the smartest men alive. For the next 12 years Faria taught Dantes all he knew, including several languages. Sadly, the day before their escape plan started, Faria had a heart attack and became paralyzed, the next day he died. Dantes faked his death thinking he would be buried but instead he was thrown out into the ocean. He then swam for an enormous amount of time until a boat picked him up. The late Abbe Faria had told him of a secret treasure that Farias master had left for him on the island of Monte Cristo. Edmond went there and found the treasure that is now worth 1 billion dollars. Edmond then changed his name into the Count of Monte Cristo after buying the island. He then became one of the most well known men in France, for several very different rumors. He held many partie and such and helped many people through times of hardship and hate. What will become of the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo?

This was one of the best books ever for me, it was enticing, thrilling, and exciting. Although I didn’t finish it while I was in France, it was a surprisingly challenging book and I enjoyed it. Also, I was exceedingly happy when I realized that it was a slow paced adventure, almost as if it could happen in real life. Although it took me a long time to read considering it was a 1200 page book, it was still an epic that keeps continuing on in my head, chapter after chapter. I recommend this book because of the reality it reflects on books, I say this because of how lifelike these characters are and how they actually have feelings. From this book you are able to see how the richest men in the world lived, or if you choose to, the poorest. From squabbles to heartbreak, from love to hate, this is one of the best stories ever told and one of the saddest.

I would give this book a five star review. Edmond Dantes is as happy as a young man can be. He has just completed a successful voyage. Unfortunately the captain of the ship died during the trip but because of the way Edmond brought the ship safely home, the owner of the ship, Mr Morrel, has told him that he will become the captain. He is off to see his beloved father and his soon to be wife, the lovely Mercedes, both of whom are waiting for him. He has everything in life to look forward to.
But like the snake in the Garden of Eden, there is one who is jealous of his good fortune, Mr Danglers, whose every hope in life is made of avarice. Edmond Dantes is a pure, happy soul who has aroused hatred in Danglers, who is is jealous of his good fortune in being named captain. It would seem that Danglers would envy and take all happiness away from Dantes, just because Danglers is not capable of truly feeling happiness and contentment himself. So he devises a plot to rob young Edmond Dantes of every bit of happiness.
There is another young man who is envious of Edmond Dantes because he has the love of the beautiful Mercedes. This is Mercedes' cousin, Fernand, who wants Mercedes for himself.
There is another that envies Dantes simply out of avarice. This is the man, Caderrouse, who wears the mask of friendship. He is the type of man who can never have enough and despite the fact that Edmond and his father have little, Caderrouse wants it.
This trio, Danglers, Fernand and Caderrouse gather together to plot the destruction of Edmond Dantes.
This story takes place in France during the exile of Napoleon Bonaparte to the
Island of Elba. The country is still very much divided between royalists and Bonapartists. The diabolical trio decides to frame poor young Dantes as a Bonapartist, working to bring Napoleon back to power. During what was going to be the homecoming and the marriage celebration, Dantes is placed under arrest and taken away, without any explanation. He is brought before a man named Villefort, a royalist in a very tenuous position as his father was a staunch Bonapartist. When he realizes that the evil lies concocted by the diabolical trio against Dantes may implicate his father and in turn him, he takes steps to ensure that Edmond Dantes will never again see the light of day. Soon poor, innocent Dantes is bound for the Chateau d'If, a horrible prison surrounded by water that those who enter never leave alive. There appears to be no further happiness possible for Edmond Dantes.
I feel like I am unable to escape the writing of Alexandre Dumas. It is a very long, melodramatic, action packed adventure. I have enjoyed every word although some surrender to the abridged version. I have heard it said that Dumas was paid by the word. That may well be but I enjoyed every word. It is filled with swashbuckling. This book is an entertaining, exciting classic even if it may not be great literature. We get to see an innocent Edmond Dantes fall into the depths only to rise as an avenging angel known as the Count of Monte Cristo! This book is super long but kept me interested in reading. Such a great story to read. A classic for sure!! It took me 2 months to read. I always read about 10-30 minutes at night before falling asleep. Awesome GREAT READ I recommend this read dearly it took me ages to finish THE book but THE most important thing is THE REWARD at THE very end. It is Worth your While. The Count of Monte Cristo"" is an unforgettable masterpiece brimming with revenge, suspense, and adventure. Alexandre Dumas has created a gripping tale that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

What I particularly loved about this book is the complexity of Edmond Dantès' character, whose journey from betrayal to triumph is both thrilling and deeply moving. The historical backdrop and vivid settings transport you straight into the heart of 19th-century France. Each plot twist is masterfully crafted, making it impossible to put down. If you’re a fan of epic tales of justice and redemption, this classic is a must-read. Prepare to be captivated! This tome is set around 150 or so years ago. The language is wonderful even with my need to regularly consult my iPhone/Kindle dictionary for dated words. The language is rich and entertaining, while the plot holds one within the story not letting go except where the author whispers in our ears with explanatory notes. The theme is about people with character, generosity and courtesy handling the evil, self-serving and greedy antagonists, lending itself perfectly to the revenge sought after by the protagonist. The whole effect is to transport you back to that time and place, while beautifully building the enigma of the hero. Enjoy! I first read The Count of Monte Cristo in abridged form and am glad to have finally read the full version. The backdrop is the chaotic politics of France from 1815-1838, and we are taken on a journey through France (largely Paris & Marseilles), Italy (Rome) and the islands of the Mediterranean.
Edmond Dantes is young, idealistic, honest and has the world at his feet. A sailor, he returns from a trip having taken over from the captain who died en route. Set to inherit the captaincy, an impressive feat for one so young, Dantes has agreed to deliver a letter, granting his old captains dying wish. However, unaware of the incendiary nature of the letter, he unwittingly opens the door for his enemies to strike.
Dantes finds himself unjustly imprisoned, the proverbial key thrown away, and in the depths of despair he meets another prisoner who transforms his life. When Dantes eventually finds his way out of prison, we meet him in several guises, including as the titular Count, a hugely wealthy, altruistic and mysterious foreigner who makes an impression on all of those he meets. As time passes, we see Monte Cristo/Dantes plans take shape, but there are unexpected consequences that he must live with.
The book is rather long, but it is well worth it. There is a wide cast of characters created with depth, the locations and events are beautifully described, and the themes of justice, hope and despair are evident throughout. There are occasional clichéd moments where the good characters are portrayed as saints, but that's my only quibble. The historical background is nicely woven in, giving a sense of purpose and reason as to why the story unfolds as it does.
Overall, I cannot recommend this enough - 100% worth your time. I saved this for a holiday, starting it on a long flight, and then dipping in when there was time to relax on the beach. Absolutely a classic. Buch sieht toll aus, hab von Barnes &Noble mehrere Bücher im Besitzt, alle wunderschön"
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (AmazonClassics Edition),"Refusing to be civilized by Southern society or cowed by his drunken father’s lashings, young Huckleberry Finn decides he has only one option left: fake his own death and hop a raft down the Mississippi River. Instead of carrying him far from trouble, though, Huck’s raft delivers him to a place of moral uncertainty.
Mark Twain unwinds Huck’s harrowing journey to manhood with satirical wit, revealing the troubled history of the American South, where slavery held sway long after the Civil War ended. Huck’s relationship with runaway slave Jim forces him to confront his beliefs about friendship and freedom.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, this edition of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Read it 60 years ago in school and loved it then, even more now. Restores some faith in American humor and decency during these ugly times. This satirical novel is the sequel to 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer' and is one of the first novels to be written in the vernacular with local color. How about this from Jim ,the slave as an example: "" I tuck out en shin down de hill, en `spec to steal a skift `long de sho' som'ers `bove de town, but dey wuz people a-stirring yit, so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go `way. Well, I wuz dah all night. Dey wuz somebody roun' all de time"". Is that great, or what? The language does slow the reader down, but emits all the local color of the mid 1850s! This is the story of Huck Finn and his adventures down the Mississippi River on a raft trying to escape his drunken father. I never saw so many words go red on Google as I did writing this review of Twain's novel. I loved this book because Twain made me feel like I was in the milieu of the South living on a Mississippian river raft. I could actually feel the heat of the day! Absolutely a great job of recreating the atmosphere of the south before things got chaotic and uncontrolable. In another words, this novel's setting is just before the North/South conflict. This is the second novel that I've read recently pertaining to this time period in the South and quite frankly I'm stunned by the Southerner's cavalier attitude towards the suffering of their slaves. Yet Mark Twain made this novel seem like it had a jocular theme, I guess that's all part of his satirical style of writing. This version of the novel has 148 illustrations and is a reproduction of the original 1885 masterpiece now published by Piccadilly Books, LTD.

Does the proverb ""boys will be boys"" mean: It is hard, often fruitless, to attempt to curb the natural playfulness and tendency to mischief of most growing boys, or does it mean Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn? I think the latter. This novel is the continuing saga of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, two 13-14 year old rascals. This story opens with Huck now living with the Widow Douglas and her sister Miss Watson. Huck has a considerable amount of money in trust with Judge Thatcher, garnered from Injun Joe in the previous Tom Sawyer book. Anyway, Huck's drunken Pap wants the money and somehow gets control of Huck's guardianship and leaves with Huck to a cabin on the banks of the Mississippi River. There Huck is constantly abused, so he fakes his death and heads down river in a canoe. He gets to Jackson's Island ( between Missouri and Illinois ) and discovers that Miss Watson's slave, Jim is there on the run from Miss Watson because he found out that she was going to sell him for $800! Huck learns that the folks back home think either Jim, or Pap killed him. They set off on a raft for incredible adventures. Jim wants his freedom and Huck wants to get away from Pap.

On Huck's journeys he runs into many difficult circumstances and harrowing escapes. First on a shore village where he meets the Granderfords, but they have a feud in progress with the Shepherdsons resulting in a big shootout as Huck egresses to the river again. Huck, now back with Jim, meets two incredible grifters on the run from a town's angry crowd. They hitch a ride with Huck and Jim on the raft and this is where the fun starts. The scams they pull off with Huck are hilarious! One of these swindlers says he is the rightful Duke of Bridgewater and the other claims to be the exiled and rightful King of France. I will not tell you anything else, but the plot thickens and the real fun reading starts at this point in the novel ( chapter XIX, page 100 ).

According to an article from Wikipedia: ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an often scathing look at entrenched attitudes, particularly racism"". The problem is as I read the novel, I was not convinced one way or the other whether Twain was being real, or satirical. I guess it's too late to ask him. Wikipedia also states: ""To highlight the hypocrisy required to condone slavery within an ostensibly moral system, Twain has Huck's father enslave him, isolate him, and beat him. When Huck escapes - which anyone would agree was the right thing to do - he then immediately encounters Jim ""illegally"" doing the same thing"". Later in Twain's career he became the harbinger of satirical comedy, but was he the future Will Rogers, or Don Rickles? Regardless of my confusion, I have to recommend this novel as it is considered one of the Great American Novels. Mark Twain’s definition of a classic book was one that was often praised and seldom read. Huckleberry Finn may fit into that category as far as adults go, and that is why I chose to read it. Honestly, reading through the southern dialect was a little tedious so I did the audiobook, which was just fine.

I had just done the audiobook for Tom Sawyer and thought I’d do HF. I had initially started HF, but Twain mentions at the beginning that HF is a continuation of TS, so I did TS first. Honestly, I felt somewhat obliged to read HF as it is so well known, but for me it was a chore. The story line in HF was more continual than in Tom Sawyer, which was to some degree just a string of iconic adventures and hi jinx, one after the other, made to entertain.

HF is more than just an entertaining story, for sure. Reconstruction had just ended in the USA, and Twain asserts that Black men (Black women weren't mentioned much) have feelings and are human and that the USA needed to accept that and move on. For HF, the frequent use of the N word seemed to pervade all reviews of the book, but while I can certainly understand it’s troubled usage, Twain, much more often than not, treats the slave Jim as a human being, though not all the time. The book ends with Jim getting his freedom, as the highlight. Twain was a humorist and a commercial success, and having him talk about slavery to a good degree downplays a truly dreadful part of our American past history.

Tom Sawyer was a lot more fun to read. Huck's trip down the Mississippi was OK, but having Huckleberry Finn narrate things, with a lot of side chatter, slowed things down in HF and occasionally I missed aspects of the plot, which I had to review. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of adventures and hi jinx in HF, too.

I can’t say I would have read it if it weren’t a “classic”, but I’m glad I have it under my belt. Great! It has been over 60 years since I first read it but it is just as fascinating now. I intend to read more of Samuel Clemens and learn about his personal jive. Be sure to read - even if you've read it before. So powerful, and speaks to all times - including our complicated world today. The masterpiece of American literature. There is no way in the world for me to praise this book enough. Laugh out loud funny, and one of the best anti-slavery books ever written. Profoundly wonderful. This review refers only to the Amazon Classics Kindle edition of ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"", and this is a comment on the publication, not the novel itself. I will say it is adequate. There is a table of contents, it is possible to jump between chapters using the Go To feature, and the formatting does not go completely ahoo when the text size is changed. Also, thankfully, I see no censorship aligning the language with modern, oh-so-touchy sensibilities.

Someday I want to find out just what is involved in preparing a text for Kindle. I might then understand why so many get it wrong. In this case it appears that someone started with a text file, and then allowed a word processor of some sort to make all the decisions. There is a difference between an apostrophe and a single open quote mark. So-called smart quote software features are not really all that smart. It takes an attentive human to make the decisions, which is to say, someone must actually read the book. This novel has perhaps the best-known use of phonetic spelling. Apostrophes leap out where they are not expected. Since no one is actually watching, the result here is often incorrect punctuation or superfluous spaces.

Incidentally, who is Clay Stafford? His name appears right under Mark Twain's in the product description, but nowhere in the e-book. What exactly was his part in this? Produit arrivé un peu en retard, mais très bel article, la couverture est juste magnifique, le livre en très bon état
Je recommande I was skeptical as to how good this book was going to be, like most things that claim to be classic I'm wary of how it will turn out, not so in this case.
The story is an enthralling one, you follow Huckleberry Finn from his perspective and the story is set after The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, the only issue I had, and it was quite minor, is that the wording is done in the dialect of Huckleberry, unless another character is talking then it uses the spelling and accent they would use, this is all explained in a foreword but can be hard at first, and be prepared as it contains liberal use of a certain word to refer to slaves, but it truly is an amazing book, I recommend it to everyone! Inhaltlich natürlich ein Meisterwerk, darauf gehe ich hier nicht ein.
Ich habe mehrere englischsprachige Ausgaben gesichtet und fand diese am besten. Kritik: Mit 22 cm Länge etwas groß fürn Taschenbuch, aber noch im Rahmen. Im Buch sind keine Kommentare, Annotationen oder andere Erläuterungen. Ich persönlich fänd eine Kurzanalyse schön, aber das ist mein persönlicher Wunsch. Positiv: Alle Illustrationen da, bezeichnet und im Fließtext eingebunden. Schriftgröße und Seitenformatierung sehr gut. Mark Twain like many great American authors had a distinguished career in the literary industry. This novel comes at the time when the great civil war that ripped the United States into two had come to a close. It was the time when all the emancipated slaves from the south started migrating towards the north and the States started a westward expansion. This story is a realization of present problems and prejudices stilling plaguing in the society.

At the start, Twain gives us a joke that the one who tries to find the plot will be killed. It’s an amazing start to the novel. This novel is a grand picture showing us a very broad cross-section of society and its prejudices. “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn”, has now become one of my favorite novels. I read a random line by Ernest Hemingway which said - “This is where the American Literature starts, nothing was before and nothing is as significant since.” Which made me pick up this novel.

When I read this novel, I realized that he wasn’t kidding at all. Twain is a genius in putting the tropes of childhood, innocence, growing up, society, and slavery in a single book and binding it through the river. This book is where that little Huckleberry Finn who was the sidekick of Tom Sawyer from The Adventures of Tom Sawyer gets the lead role in the story. Huck’s journey from being naïve to growing up emotionally with the runaway slave Jim, serene beauty of the Mississippi, and the cruel pre-civil war American south keep us locked into the book.

This is one of those Great American Novels, the real transcendentalist thought that Emerson, Thoreau, and Whitman believed in. But the effort of the reader to find the American character in Huck in the context of a tragedy is heartbreaking for everyone. This book is in every way comparable to Don Quixote, and you will even enjoy reading that too. The two most interesting things in this novel are the usage of first-person perspective contrary to its prequel, which makes it way more immersive and dramatic, and the usage of the ‘n’ word. We again here need to understand that Twain is writing for an audience at his time in the local dialect when the word was commonly used. The ending somewhat makes everyone surprise. I liked the way Twain played the game towards the end but not many may like it. Twain again showed that Tom is always the boss in his friends. This book makes you get bored, fell in love with the characters, laugh with them for Twain’s amazing literary humor, get emotionally connected with them, cry alongside them, and in the end close the book exclaiming how a book can be so beautiful.

The book contains every conflict and debate in today’s world. This is contemporary, though not by times but by the societal prejudices. This can be in contention for what America might call a national epic even though it ain’t a poem. This book isn’t a onetime read at all. Do give it a read. You won’t be disappointed. From one angle, it’s a tale of an adventure to find freedom, for Huck it is freedom from civilization, and for Jim, freedom from slavery, it is a picture of a world of prejudices; it is a drama of moral conflict. A world which is filled with smugness, illiteracy, boredom, anarchy, prejudices, bravery, cowardice, and brutality. I would like to conclude by saying that this is a book which contains humor about a completely opposite world. prima"
Little Women (AmazonClassics Edition),"As a New England mother struggles to support her family in the wake of her husband’s service in the Civil War, her four daughters struggle, too—caught between childhood dreams and the realities of burgeoning adulthood. For Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March, raised in integrity and virtue, negotiating the right path in life means making choices that will either narrow or expand their destinies.
Based on the author’s life, Little Women transcends genre, gender, and class with its examination of personal quests, societal restrictions, family ties, and the end of innocence.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Little Women, this edition of Little Women (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This timeless children's classic is read and enjoyed by many adults as well as children. Unlike most classics considered children's works today, Little Women was intended for an audience of children. It takes place during the Civil War and the years following, and narrates the story of 4 girls as they grow up, including their friends and their family. Louisa May Alcott based this work in large part on her family, although many of the events are born totally of her imagination. Jo is based on Louisa May; Meg is based on her older sister Anna; Beth is based on her younger sister Elizabeth, or Lizzie; and Amy is based on her youngest sister May. Because the character Jo is based on the author herself, she is the most well defined character in the book and the one most children identify with. A tomboy, a writer, and quite determined, Jo is the central figure in the book and most events center around her growing up, but all of the other girls get special attention in stories particularly about them from time to time.

There is a great sense of morality in the work, but it is never treated in a 'preachy' manner. Values and morals are taught and absorbed by the reader as the girls learn them through various trials, some funny, some sorrowful, some frustrating. There is likewise a very strong emphasis on God. Much of the first half of the book centers around concepts found in the Puritan work, Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan. The girls are often pointed by their mother toward God and placing their trust in Him and seeking His aid in various situations. Louisa May Alcott was also a transcendentalist and her family was close friends with Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Because of this, there is a sense of joy found in nature as well as respect. In addition, Louisa May was an avid feminist in her day, although not in the sense of feminist that many think of today. She believed that women should not be barred from admission in the workforce, or limited to work as seamstresses or governesses, nor should marriage be their only avenue of insuring a stable and secure future. She did not get married, but did raise her sister May's daughter after May died. Little Women is definitely not anti-marriage, but some of the characters dream of becoming well-known in their favorite fields; also, some of the characters speak about how the only way they can insure a positive, pleasant future is by marrying well, which is later rejected in a way that asserts that women should be able to choose marriage freely for love, not for position or money and likewise free to choose not to marry.

This book is well loved by so many. It spurs many children on to become strong readers for life and the childhood copy of Little Women will become worn from much loved reading. This book will be loved by most girls, but boys will enjoy it as well. Jo's tomboyish behavior and the neighbor boy, Laurie's presence will attract the attention of boys. It makes a great choice for bedtime reading with chapters of perfect length to read one per night and short enough that if begged by the kids, you can read two. In addition to Little Women, it would also be beneficial to read a biography of Louisa May Alcott.

I strongly recommend an unabridged version. Don't miss out on the well-known sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys. Five stars forever and ever. Little Women is my favorite classic.

This book is a coming-of-age story about the March sisters (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) growing up in New England during the Civil War. Out of all the March sisters, I’ve always resonated with Jo the most, from her writing down to the potential spinster path (sometimes Amy too). My family is tight-knit like the March family and similar in that we get along and fight at times, but at the end of the day, we have so much love for each other.

I highly recommend Little Women. It’s funny, heartwarming, and inspirational. I can’t say enough good things about it. READ IT. After reading Blue Sisters by Coco Mellors, my interest to Little Women rose, and I opened my stored book to observe how the story goes. Each girl has her unique character, and they grow mature throughout the story. I cannot wait to read the next book. Im 34 and this just maybe a new favorite of mine! Brilliant! Transformative! Heartbreaking! Heartwarming! Thought provoking! Lovely! All encompassing! Great addition to bookshelf Please don't pass these by because they're old, or you read them when you were little. These delightful stories- and you- deserve to be enjoyed even now.
The language is from 100 years ago. It’s good old American English, spoken by persons of privilege who could teach the one percenters of today a thing or two about wealth and its use.
Women balance domestic life, and the struggle for freedom in a society ruled by men. Blacks and the Irish are still servants when they appear, Native Americans are acknowledged as people from whom all was taken. Louisa May Alcott was brave to include these things. But the tenderness of her tales, and the thrill of their adventures still captivate and delight. You'll cheer the good guys, boo the bad guys, make fun of the fools, and recognize them all, because their descendants live next door. Trust me, you'll be delighted and surprised to see that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Times will always be tough. Good stories like these will always entertain us through the gloom and give us hope. This is one of my favorite books, and luckily I’ve read it multiple times so I was surprised to get to the end and find the last chapter and a half was missing from my copy. Any chance I could get a new one free of charge? Good book. Liked the in-depth stories of the girls, lives. How they grew up so differently in a loving family. Felt good with the ending Enligt beskrivningen. Det är en present! I was expecting just the book Little Women, especially for it being a hardcover for less than €10, but the book contains 47-chapters instead of the expected 23, so I was pleasantly surprised! I like this series (Chartwell) in general, it’s quite affordable and they are pretty good books for the amount you pay. Una storia fantastica
Edizione in lingua originale, bella e raffinata, che include sia piccole donne che piccole donne crescono. Proprio quello che cercavo!! Esta maravilla de la literatura americana me ha parecido magnífica. Lo que más destaca son los valores morales narrados de una forma que hace que no quieras que la familia de los March y amigos salgan de tu vida cuando llegues al final del libro. Al hacerlo te dejara un dulce sabor que te acompañará siempre. Very good written book with a very interesting story. For teenager and adults!"
Crime and Punishment (AmazonClassics Edition),"Living in a squalid room in St. Petersburg, the indigent but proud Rodion Raskolnikov believes he is above society. Obsessed with the idea of breaking the law, Raskolnikov resolves to kill an old pawnbroker for her cash.
Although the murder and robbery are bungled, Raskolnikov manages to escape without being seen. And with nothing to prove his guilt and a mendacious confessor in police custody, Raskolnikov seems to have committed the perfect crime. But in Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s world of moral transgressions, with its reason and its consequences, Raskolnikov’s plan has a devastating hitch: the feverish delirium of his own conscience.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds. ""Out of Shakespeare, there is no more exciting reading than Dostoevsky"" -- Virginia Woolf. I agree. I would like to add that, in all of Dostoevsky, there is no more exciting reading than ""Crime and Punishment."" Let me take that a step further. In ""Crime and Punishment,"" there is no more exciting reading than Constance Garnett's translation of THE climactic exchange between murderer Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov and detective Porfiry Petrovitch:

"" 'Then...who then...is the murderer?' he (Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov) asked in a breathless voice, unable to restrain himself.

"" Porfiry Petrovitch sank back in his chair, as though he were amazed at the question. 'Who is the murderer?' he repeated, as though unable to believe his ears. 'Why, you, Rodion Romanovitch! You are the murderer,' he added, almost in a whisper, in a voice of genuine conviction. ""

Wow! It just doesn't get any better, any more exciting, any more dramatic than that. Better than any other translator, Constance Garnett knocks the reader out of the armchair!! See for yourself. Compare. I could prove my point by quoting from another translation or two. But that would only bore you. And where's the fun in that? Not there. But here. Here in Chapter Two of Part Six of Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" AS TRANSLATED BY CONSTANCE GARNETT.

I don't care whether a translation is true to the original or not. Truth has no place in the world of dramatic fiction. If a translation improves upon the original, so much the better. Shakespeare improved upon Plutarch, did he not? For those who insist on literal translation, I would advocate for interlinear translation, which would allow us Engloids to ""read between the lines"" of the Russian original.

I first read Constance Garnett's translation of Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" when I was a student at Boston Latin School, fifty years ago. That translation seems to have gotten better with age. I would like to say the same about my self. But I won't. I can't. Why not? I'll tell you why not! I do not live ""in the world of dramatic fiction."" That's why not.

Cheers! Happy reading!!

P.S. For more on Dostoevsky and ""Crime and Punishment,"" please see Joseph Frank's ""Dostoevsky: the Miraculous Years, 1865-71,"" and Mikhail Bakhtin's ""Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics.""

P.P.S. Eureka! I have found it!! By ""it,"" I mean the ""little fact"" that Porfiry tells Raskolnikov he (Porfiry) has, but won't reveal. Part Six, Chapter Two. OK. So. Porfiry refuses to tell Raskolnikov what his ""little fact"" is. Very well. Be that way. I, by contrast, am not so coy. I will tell my fellow Amazonians what Porfiry's ""little fact"" is. Porfiry's ""little fact"" is Raskolnikov's phony ""pledge"" item: a tightly wrapped-and-tied piece of metal-and-wood that Raskolnikov had made at home. Part One, Chapter Six. Raskolnikov told the pawnbroker it was ""a silver cigarette case,"" handed it to her, and then murdered her. Part One, Chapter Seven. It was found in her hand after the murder. Epilogue. So. There you have it. Porfiry's ""little fact"" you can ""get your hands on."" Part Six, Chapter Two. How about that! Bingo!! ""Never mind all this psychology stuff,"" as Porfiry might put it. Raskolnikov's phony ""pledge"" item in the murdered pawnbroker's hand was physical evidence that placed Raskolnikov right there, right then: at the murder scene, at the time of the murder. Got 'im.

SECOND THOUGHTS FROM A DOUBTING THOMAS: We readers of Part One, Chapters Six and Seven, know all about the connection between Raskolnikov and the phony ""pledge"" item that was found in the pawnbroker's hand after the murder. Epilogue. My guess is that said ""pledge"" item was the ""little fact"" that Porfiry mentioned in Part Six, Chapter Two. Be that as it may, I ask myself whether Porfiry would have been able to link that ""pledge"" item to Raskolnikov -- without the benefit of Raskolnikov's confession!? We readers know that the ""pledge"" item found in the pawnbroker's hand after the murder was Raskolnikov's homemade decoy. Part One, Chapter Six. It was designed to -- and it did -- absorb all the attention of the pawnbroker. Part One, Chapter Seven. Diverted and pre-occupied with untying and unwrapping the ""pledge"" item, the pawnbroker became unaware of Raskolnikov as he opened his coat, pulled out his axe, and raised it over her head. Id. After the murder, the ""pledge"" item was found in the pawnbroker's hand. Epilogue. OK. So. There you have it. The ""little fact."" Part Six, Chapter Two. The thing ""you can get your hands on."" Id. That raises this question: Was there anything in, on, or about the ""pledge"" item that could connect it to Raskolnikov? I don't know the answer to that question. I think I'm so smart. And yet, I'm stumped. I really am. Assuming the ""pledge"" item found in the hand of the murdered pawnbroker came from the murderer, such a murderer must have known that the pawnbroker made loans secured by ""pledge"" items. Such knowledge, however, was common knowledge. Everybody knew. But not everybody would be allowed in by the pawnbroker. There were no signs of entry having been forced. So, the pawnbroker must have let the murderer in. Whom would she let in? Someone she knew. A known customer, quite likely. A known customer bearing a ""pledge"" item. Raskolnikov was the last customer to come forward and claim valuables pawned before the murder. So, in a narrow field of promising suspects (i.e., customers of the pawnbroker), Raskolnikov was the one who stood out. But still! Raskolnikov's delay in coming forward is psychological or behavioral evidence, not physical evidence, not a ""thing"" that you can ""get your hands on."" Part Six, Chapter Two. By contrast, the ""pledge"" item found in the hand of the murdered pawnbroker IS physical evidence. Epilogue. How could Porfiry connect Raskolnikov to that ""pledge"" item? That is the question. The easy answer is that Raskolnikov's confession made the connection. Epilogue. The more difficult question is this: What if Raskolnikov had not confessed? How could Porfiry have connected Raskolnikov to the ""pledge"" item found in the murdered pawnbroker's hand? By other physical evidence? By psychological and/or behavioral evidence? By something else? By some other way? I wonder.

I also wonder whether Porfiry's ""little fact"" might be the stone under which Raskolnikov hid what he had stolen from the pawnbroker. Raskolnikov told Zametov about the stone; Zametov told Porfiry; and Porfiry asked Raskolnikov to leave a note about the stone if he decided to commit suicide. Such a note would give Porfiry a ""thing he could get his hands on,"" together with Raskolnikov's own handwriting connecting him to it.

Oy! All this writing, all this thinking, all this reading, all this . . . What, in the end, what does all this come down to? I am left guessing, wondering, thinking, writing. What if Porfiry's ""little fact"" was something other than the ""pledge""? something other than the stone? something else entirely? something I did not write down? something that did not even occur to me? What then? Who knows? Who can say? I, for one, cannot say. For, I do not know. I want to know. But I do not know. I am left wondering. To this day, this hour, this moment, that is all I can do. I can only wonder. And THAT, to my way of thinking, is not a bad state of mind to be in. Not bad at all. Good, actually. Even wonderful. Yes. Of course. Now I see it clear and say it plain: It is wonderful to wonder!

PENULTIMATE PARAGRAPH: By continually referring to Alyona Ivanova not by her name, but as ""the pawnbroker,"" I took away her identity, her personality, her life. I did not intend to do so. Nor would I want to do so. And yet, I did do so -- unintentionally, inadvertently, not knowing what I did. Unfortunately, this is one of those contexts in which a person is identified not by who they are (Alyona Ivanova) but by what they do (pawnbroker). So, please. Help me out here. Do me a favor. When you read ""pawnbroker,"" think ""Alyona Ivanova.""

ULTIMATE PARAGRAPH: Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov deserved the death penalty. Alyona Ivanova and her step-sister Lizaveta did not. Their lives were infinitely more valuable and virtuous than his. They did not coldly and calculatedly butcher two innocent defenseless old ladies. He did. They did not deserve to die. He did. Never have I had such a love / hate relationship with a novel.

To be fair, there wasn't anything I necessarily hated about Crime and Punishment, rather, there were just so many times I was frustrated with it. In an earlier update I made as I was reading this I compared the book to jazz and as a precursor to novels such as 'Manhattan Transfer' and the modern art movement. I still stand by that statement but I feel Dostoyevsky's novel was more of a fitful start to the 'modern' movement and that it would take a much more conscience effort by later writers to really improve this style of novel writing.

Of course, Dostoyevsky didn't set out to write the first 'modern' novel, but he was reacting to modern life and the freedoms that come with it. And that's the odd thing about this book - the freedom that suffocates our characters. True, most everyone in the book is wretchedly poor and thus shackled by poverty or alcoholism or pride or some other wicked vice, but they're free to decide how to behave in such a setting. Everyone is bothered by regrets; except Sofia (the hooker we never see turn a trick and who has the now over-done 'heart of gold' trope) but they're all regrets that were of their own conscience making. They chose to kill, or be lecherous, or terrible in some other way and they knew it and they all regretted it. There was no one to guide them - everyone in authority was either non existent or corrupt in some way - and so this 'modern' world has to be navigated blind.

And that's the problem. All this freedom is stifling. Nobody knows what to do. Nobody knows if they even have free-will. Nobody has an identity - except, of course, Sofia. Raskolnikov kills two people just to feel something, anything, to see what he's 'made of', what his place in society is and when he gets to Siberia he finally feels free because he now knows his place. And he resents it, which is pretty funny and probably this joked is missed because the rest of the book is so damn depressing, but it's funny that he hates it all but at least he knows what to hate. It's a wonderful joke Dostoyevsky tells here and makes the rest of the book worth it.

So I'm not sure the book could have been written any different, but the claustrophobia of it all, the long soliloquy's that, while fascinating, really go on and on and on and never really resolve anything - which is why it's funny when Razumikhin says we'll talk our way to the truth.

The fact Dostoyevsky was able to pull this novel off is a feat and makes the book earn its place as a true masterpiece. I personally don't think I ever want to revisit it and I'm wary of reading more Dostoyevsky, but I loved that the book challenged me so much and it did have some wonderful moments that are truly unforgettable - the horse beating, the murders, anything concerning Svidrigailov.

As a student of human behavior (and I use the term cautiously after reading this book), Crime and Punishment is a must read for its psychology and for its art. I can't give it 5 stars (so arbitrary, but here we are) because of my own personal tastes, but it is a '5 star' novel in every regard.

I loved it and I hated it; which is why it was almost perfect. It is The Brothers Karamozov. I read it anyway, and it was a good story, just not what I thought I was downloading. Fyodor is one the greatest classic writer. His work is literally blows your mind.
One of the greatest Russian literature writer.
As I uploaded the pics, the book is delivered very well. Thanx to Amazon.
And thanx to Fingerprint Publication for making these books available for us. I’m still a new to reading novels, so my opinion may change in the future, but I have say that for one of my first novels to read I feel like I’ve read a master piece!
How the characters in the novel are written, makes them feel real and connectable to.
The description of the characters, their personalities and the places where events happened is very likable as well.
The way I can hear the characters’ thoughts made me sometime feel like I was the person living and thinking that way, as if I were them! onetime I even felt almost going crazy as one of the characters was going crazy!
It is in the psychological genre and it does a great job at it, but I would advise to stay away from it if you’re not fond of that genre.
As a last note, as a non English native speaker the novel was a little hard to read(I needed to use the translator a couple of times).
TLDR;
I felt like I read a master piece.
It was enjoyable, makes you feel like you are the character him/her self, the way the characters and their thoughts are presented is fantastic and makes them connectable to and makes the reader able to understand them.
I liked it a lot, I definitely recommend it to anyone into the psychological genre. Great reading
A classic 中学生の時に翻訳版を読んでいます。当時は主人公の「1つの罪は100の善行によって償われる」という考えに唸りました。主人公を応援する心情で読んだものでしたが、今再び読んでみて主人公の傲慢さ、というかただの精神病じゃないかと……。主人公には嫌悪を感じました。大体、綿密に計画し信念のもとに行っているはずなのに肝心のお金はとってこれず、思い切り体調まで崩して情緒すら不安定で。実行前の雄々しさはどこに？まあ主人公がめちゃくちゃな反面、ラズミーヒンの献身が目を引きヒーローとして見守れたのは良かったです。 👍"
Moby Dick (AmazonClassics Edition),"Ignoring prophecies of doom, the seafarer Ishmael joins the crew of a whaling expedition that is an obsession for the ship’s captain, Ahab. Once maimed by the White Whale, Moby Dick, Ahab has set out on a voyage of revenge. With godlike ferocity, he surges into dangerous waters—immune to the madness of his vision, refusing to be bested by the forces of nature.
An exhilarating whaling yarn, an apocalyptic theodicy, a tragic confessional, and a profound allegory, Moby Dick encompasses all that it means to be human—from the physical and metaphysical to the spiritual and emotional. Full of strange wisdom and wild digressive energy, it’s a singular literary performance universally regarded as one of the great American novels.
Revised edition: Previously published as Moby Dick, this edition of Moby Dick (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This year, I want to attempt to read some of the old classic material. This was the first of this year, and I'm finally glad I read it. The flow of the story was enjoyable, and I loved the old English conversations between the crew and the writing style. There were times I needed to re-read areas , as we are not used to that style of speech today.
Definitely a classic must read. Now, to choose my next classic. I don't know where to begin. I've read Jules V, HP Lovecraft, Shelly's Frankenstein, Poe, and HG wells.
Any
I'm open to suggestions? Moby Dick, by Herman Melville, is one of the greatest American contributions to world literature. Although it is often labeled as a novel, and indeed it does begin as one, the book is sui generis, and contains multiple digressions in the plot that make Moby Dick a thoroughly distinct work. Notorious for its difficulty, and infamous for its many chapter's describing the mechanics and history of whaling, Melville's book is now regarded as a classic par excellence.

What are we to make of this book? It is one of the strangest that I've ever encountered, and I reckon myself pretty well versed in strange books. For one, this is the most overt effort to write a 'classic' that I've come across. Melville knows what he's going for, and he self-conciously pulls out every trick in his bag. The book is firmly grounded in the Western canon, making references to Shakespeare, Locke, Milton, Kant, Plato, the Bible, Goethe, and Coleridge, among others. It is also meticulously researched, with virtually whole bibliographies on whaling and whale-stories contained within. It seems that Melville's White Whale was greatness, and he pursued it with a madman's ire, lashing out at it with every harpoon in his armory. In fact, Moby Dick was not well-received during his lifetime, and so perhaps Melville even shared in Ahab's fate.

In the book, Ishmael uses everything on board the ship to serve as a metaphor for something else, until, in the end, the ship is as riddled with metaphors as with the rigs, ropes, and lines that cross her hull. Meaning is ever-elusive, and one thing can stand for ten others. The best example of this is, obviously, Moby Dick, who can take on almost infinite meanings. Is he nature, punishing the whalers for their slaughter of his kinsmen? Is he Melville's struggle with greatness? With God? Or is Moby Dick simply Fate? Or, is Moby Dick a pre-Freudian psychological device? The object of Ahab's displaced fears, hopes, and anger? Is Moby Dick a phallic symbol (his name is straightforward enough)? A ram-shaped whale, filled with white spermaceti! I hate to be coarse, but the work asks these questions, and a thousand more.

Melville also gives us a consummate tragic character, Captain Ahab, who seems to be a composite of nearly every other tragic figure that came before: Achilles, Orestes, King Lear, Hamlet, Faust, and Satan from Paradise Lost. Added to that, Melville blends with Ishmael several times during the narrative, becoming both part of the story as well as the author. He makes no attempt to hide the process of creation, giving Moby Dick a strickingly modernist feel at times.

But is Moby Dick a perfect work? Not a soul would argue that. Some chapters on whaling are indeed excessive, Melville's prose, while often brilliant, has a tendency to become labyrinthine and over-precise during his technical explanations. The storyline itself is actually quite short, and is told in the first and last 10% of the book, the middle 80% consisting of a monumentously ambitious literary experiment (some of which he could have spared us). But I regard these flaws as I do the scar that runs the length of Ahab's body: the flaw that makes perfection. The entire work itself becomes some sort of allegory for Ahab's character: monomaniacal, brilliant, flawed, and over-extended. Blast you, Melville, you're a genius after all. Moby Dick by Herman Melville, accompanied by King Lear by W. Shakespeare and the Regarding the Pain of Others by Susan Sontag, was a monthly reading for a book club. Obviously, Moby Dick was the centerpiece of the dining, with its sheer volume compared to the others, and a myriad of topics it unraveled. Chapter 96, the Try-Works was one of the most intense chapters. While describing oil-extraction operation from sperm, Ismael observed that ""Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body"", which reminded me the ""Seven Steps Verse or Quatrain of Seven Steps 七步詩 allegedly ciphered by 曹植, Cao Zhi, i.e., ""People burn the beanstalk to boil beans, / The beans in the pot cry out. / We are born of the selfsame root, / Why should we hound each other to death with such impatience?"" Ismael also ascertained that ""the truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows (Isaiah 53), ..., and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe. ""All is vanity."" ALL."", which followed ""But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable) thing occurred to me... Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of DEATH, came over me."" Alas, Ahab should have heeded that.
Shakespearean influences can be found everywhere in the book. As can be noted, the Parsee's self-fulfilling prophecies sounded like those weird ones by the witches in Macbeth. Another interesting part of the book was Chapter 54, The Town-Ho's Story, which seemed to be the most absorbing chapter. As a story within a story; or another layer of stories under such stories, probably this chapter may have many twists, tricks, and/or plots for this specific story. That is, I doubted that such an arguably good one happened to become the head of a mutiny, I held that he was meant to be the one who led such mutiny, a rebellious one in his nature. How about the bad guy who happened to trigger the feud led to the mutiny? He probably was a bad one, but it would be absurd to move the whole burden of such mutiny to an insolent one, not onto the desperado.
When I told one of my senior friends during mountain tracking last month that I was reading the Moby Dick, he suggested that the book should be read as a good business novel. He observed that the characters could be better understood if we put the characters and situations in the book into a corporate setting or business context. Indeed the book itself is about crews in whaling business - risky, profitable, and overly-exploited -, hence business perspectives underlying in the story. How about the intense politics by and between Ahab and Starbuck? Ahab seemed to be worried about the possibility of a mutiny led by Starbuck should he had gone too far. In Chapter 109, Ahab showed his unexpected self-restraint when he was confronted with Starbuck about how to deal with leaking barrels. At the end of the day, he was just an executive hired by principal owners, i.e. Captain Bildad and Captain Peleg, of the ship. How about Captain Ahab's elite whaling troupe, led by the Parsee? We have seen secret elite groups or standing task forces within large corporations. Even their phone numbers are not listed on the company directory, those groups do jobs directly mandated by the highest executives behind the scene. Having gained confidence after a series of tugs-of-war with Starbuck and his crews, or just out of nervous impatience, Ahab went all out, with Pip as his sidekick. As Ahab seized initiatives, Starbuck yielded to Ahab's authority. Chapter 132 was the most hilarious one: As Ahab exhibited a kind of ""When I was young"" tirade, or ""Latte is Horse.."", a pun in Korean, Starbuck just came down to give Ahab flattery: ""Oh, my captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!"" Although he knew what would come to him and his crew, he just followed his Fate, not stood against her, which is common in failling corporations. “Poet, painter and philosopher” a reviewer once called Melville. His subject matter and writing style are welded together as firmly as the 12 intertwining steel rods that make up Ahab’s harpoon and the fate of Ahab and the whale itself. The epic process of trawling through until the final confrontation mirrored The Pequod’s journey to same.

As the end approached and I caught whiff, through one nostril, of the white whale’s proximity in the final pages, I deliberately slowed down my reading to more fully appreciate the journey, and because by now my reading eyes had synced with Melville’s Shakespearean rhythms, swirling poetry, dry wit, and grandiloquent turn of phrase, the final chapters were more joy than reward.

The wit - after the crew had hauled all the heavy oil barrels up on deck:
“top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head”.

and:
“The (whale’s) milk is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with strawberries.”

The poetic:
“In the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and softcymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that the gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.”

The tormented Shakespearean soliloquizer:
“what cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that living, and not I.”

The philosophical:
“consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life”

And the haughty self-referential:
“To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.”

Never was a book’s plot more secondary to its themes. It’s man versus everything; fate, circumstance, demons, ego, expectation, classism, religion, God, nature, empathy, understanding, brotherhood, the universe.
An unforgettable and hard-won experience. book received in excellent condition La edición es increíble, tapa dura con sobrecubierta, buena encuadernación. El precio es buenísimo sin estar de oferta. El libro en sí es increíble, pero la lectura de este clásico es exigente, pero vale la pena.
He visto algún comentario que la sobrecubierta viene raspada, pero no es cierto, es el diseño original que simula el impacto de la ballena y al estar en blanco da otra impresión. The quality of the pages and the cover are not ideal. Ich war schon in meiner Jugend grosser Moby Dick Fan (als Mädchen!) und habe damals das Original auf englisch verschlungen und durfte mir zur Belohnung dann eine der Verfilmungen ansehen.
Moby Dick von Melville gilt ja als einer DER Jugenbuchklassiker seiner Zeit.
Da das Original und auch die meisten Übersetzungen des Originals ins deutsche relativ kompliziert geschrieben sind und zahlreiche naturwissenschaftliche, philosophische und politische detaillierte Abhandlungen enthalten sind, ist es für Jugendliche oder ungeübte erwachsene Leser keine ""leichte Kost"".
Aus diesem Grund wird hier eine vereinfachte und leichter verständliche Version angeboten.
Ich wollte auch meiner Tochter die Geschichte um Moby Dick nahe bringen, gerade jetzt wo in der Schule viel über Umweltschutz, verschmutzte Meere, Walfang etc. gelehrt wird.
Meine Tochter hat das Buch selber gelesen und es hat ihr sehr gut gefallen. Die Originalversion auf englisch wäre für sie zu schwierig gewesen um es alleine zu verstehen. Aber mit dieser Ausgabe ging es, auch wenn ich öfter helfen musste. Genau wie in meiner Jugend damals habe ich nach Lektüre des Buchs mit ihr gleich zwei Moby Dick Verfilmungen angeschaut und ihr gefielen alle drei Versionen (Buch und Filme) gleich gut. Bei den Filmen hat ihr gefallen dass der Walfang genauer erläutert wurde und auch viele Skizzen und Zeichnungen eingeblendet wurden. Das hilft der Vorstellungskraft! Hätte aber ihre Phantasie ruiniert und die Leselust gemindert, hätte ich sie zuerst die Filme sehen lassen.
Von uns gibt es eine ganz klare Leseempfehlung für Jungs und Mädchen ab ca. 10 Jahren. Geübte erwachsene Leser sollten zum alten englischen Original oder zur Langfassung der deutschen Übersetzung greifen.

AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Arabian Nights, this edition of The Arabian Nights (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Excitement, intrigue, suspense.... really, just great story telling! As a child, you read of Sinband the Sailor and rubbing a magic lamp to find a genie with three wishes. As an adult, you can bring this all back by reading this well wrtten/translated labyrinth of stories. Each storyteller has a story and one leads to another, all interwoven. It is hard to put down.

Before you think this is just an old fashioned, studious piece of literature, believe me, it is so imaginative and rich. Each story is relatively short, so you can read at your own pace; either one story a night, or several stories at a time.

This is a great read for those who love to be swept away to a different time and place. I could see readers of Harry Potter, adventure readers and even those with a short attention span who prefer to read short stories enjoying these Arabian tales!I can't wait to recommend this old school book to my friends. They'll be so surprised! It was a great book but it has to much witchcraft

I chose it because my parents told me to read it and I found it was great Book was as advertised! No issue with the pages themselves. The bookmark-ribbon though was frayed and cut short, so I removed it. I also printed a custom dust jacket more befitting of the book! As for the narrative itself, I love Haddawy’s translation and recommend it for first-time readers over the flowery yet incredibly orientalist translations of Lane and Burton. This is basically the Grimm Fairy Tales equivalent for East Asia, India, and the Middle East. You can imagine these tales told orally by skillful speakers.

There are stories within stories within stories, an interesting device. (It's like ""Inception,"" where you go down the dream layers and then have to return upwards, and then you have to try and remember the upper layers after time away from them.)

There are lots of kings and rulers and beautiful princesses and handsome princes. Very few good-looking people turn out to be jerks. There is magic and magical creatures, but not in every story. It's a great look at human imagination over the generations.

These are the main lessons from these tales: Traits such as industry, wisdom, graciousness, and generosity are admired. Greed, dishonesty, and laziness are scorned. Wealth is admired so long as you are generous with it. A good story may save your life. A good sob story will make people feel sorry for you and give you money. Everyone eventually gets what they deserve. Punishments are harsh, so beware! Kids used to be introduced to these tales as a part of growing up, even though they might not have known the familiar stories were from this book. As children we thought the culture behind this collection was so exotic, but yet the concept was so understandable -- here are people from a different era and a different part of the world, yet we understand them and are interested in their experiences as if they were anything like our own. There's something endearing about the timelessness of this collection, though the stories are so many and are repetitive. I think that's why we were exposed to the individual tales in bits and pieces; the book cannot hold a child's attention when delivered as a whole. An adult will find things in it that nostalgically remind him of something from his childhood -- too bad developments in the modern world have spoiled the comfortable concept of Arabian Nights for us. It’s cool to see how many modern adaptations have been made from this book. Aladdin, sinbad,prince of Persia…. To name a few I had no idea what the Tales of the Arabian Nights was all about until I read this book. Besides the entertaining tales one learns what it must have been like to have lived in the late Medeaval (European) period in what is today war torn Iraq. Islamic society does not appear to have been, at that time and now (from my own experience of having lived in the Middle East for five years in the 1950s), terribly draconian, and refreshingly so. My copy seems to have been banned from a New England public library, I'm assuming because it is by today's standards so trumpishly politically incorrect: dude-centric, super hot gorgeous and submissive females, lavish feasting and carousing scenes, lots of sex, either explicit (but in very polite terms) or implied. Besides all that, the English translation is truly ""awesome."" The Arabian Nights needs no review, as a classic. It is the delight of all story lovers, young and old. I read it first as a teenager, and now at age 80! The stories are as delightful as when I read them first. Translated beautifully into The type of prose fit for the best of stories in the world! 話の続きにつられてついついページをめくってしまうので読みやすいです。

そういう細かい点が気にならないなら、楽しく読めると思います。 Such an amazing book every story is worth reading I loved it every single story in it thank you amazon These are the most wonderful stories everyone should know and understand the meaning, the lessons it teaches us. Happy Reading. For my ninth birthday in 1952 my aunty gave me a very large thick book, ""A Thousand and One Nights"", Children's Edition. It was the complete collection of all the stories.

These stories captivated my imagination. I loved the way they were written, even at my age.

Some scenes from these stories have always been with me . . . the adventure, the fantasy, the magic.

Many of the stories are short, some being a story within a story.

A few years later I say ""The Thief of Bagdad"", starring Sabu . . . not to be confused with the 1924 original.

Unfortunately I do not still have the book with me, as I lent it to someone in Darwin in 1965 and forgot to retrieve it before I left.

I would recommend the book ""The Arabian Nights"" as enthralling reading for anyone who loves a good fantasy. Una favola allucinante in grado di trasportare in mondi lontani grandi e piccini. Ammiro la struttura a spirale del testo."
The Phantom of the Opera (AmazonClassics Edition),"A phantom has haunted the Paris Opera House for years. Now he is infatuated with singer Christine Daaé. Despite an astonishing debut performance, Christine fails to win the lead in Faust, and the Phantom’s cursed retaliation on the opera house is spectacularly fatal. As the chandelier falls, he kidnaps Christine, and through hidden passages and behind trapdoors, shares his life story with her. To secure her escape, Christine promises to stay true to him forever. But when the Phantom learns of the prima donna’s intention to flee, his passion turns terrifying.
With its complex and victimized antihero, a man at once evil and misjudged, Gaston Leroux’s Grand Guignol has become a fixture of romantic popular culture and the dark absolute of obsessive love.

Revised edition: Previously published as The Phantom of the Opera, this edition of The Phantom of the Opera (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This was far from being my first experience with Leroux's story, but it WAS my first time reading an unabridged English translation. For anyone unaware, the standard English translation (which is usually published without a translator's name) is abridged, but not labeled as such. That translation was what I was previously familiar with, but having been a fan of PotO for nearing a decade, I thought it was high time I read a different translation...

And honestly, I'm not sure how good this one is. Given that Ribière is French herself, I assumed that her translation would be most faithful, but there were several points in the text where I found glaring errors (most notably in the epilogue, where a translation mishap sent the Samarkand merchant to fetch Erik from the fair, instead of the Daroga). But, as I'm not perfectly fluent in French (and don't have a copy of the French text handy to compare them, anyway), I can't speak adequately on the accuracy of this translation.

I may be in the minority, but I have always vastly preferred Leroux to Lloyd-Webber's musical. The novel's atmosphere can't be matched, in my opinion. Written as detective fiction, Leroux's speaker is investigating (years after the events of the novel) the legend of the ""Phantom of the Opera,"" a mysterious specter that wreaked havoc at the Palais Garnier in years past. During his investigation, he begins to suspect that there are ties between the Phantom, the murder of Count Philippe de Chagny, and the disappearances of his younger brother, Raoul, and an opera singer called Christine Daaé.

Thus, Leroux takes the reader on a journey into the past, often referencing interviews with, and written documents by, several prominent figures at the opera at the time of the ""de Chagny affair."" Most of the fantastic tale is seen from the perspective of Raoul de Chagny, whose love for his childhood friend, Christine, seems to be thwarted by an unseen rival - a disembodied voice which has convinced the pious Christine that it belongs to the Angel of Music. Raoul and Christine soon find themselves trapped in a nightmare, as the love-sick ""Angel"" has no intentions of letting his beloved wed another.

The narrative often shifts to the perspective of the opera's directors, who are at their wits' end with the Phantom's outrageous demands. Most of the latter section of the novel is told from the point-of-view of the Persian, a figure from the Phantom's past who is often left out of film and stage adaptations.

In this day and age, most readers already know the plot to the story, so the strength in Leroux's writing lies less in the ""mystery"" of it all, and more in his beautiful language and imagery. It is all too easy to imagine the graveyard at Perros-Guirec, laden with snow and blood-red roses, littered with skulls, eerily silent under the full moon. The reader can understand Raoul's terror when he comes face-to-face with the ""Death's head"" in such a setting. Leroux's detailed descriptions of the opera house, too, lend a sense of realism to the story that leaves the reader wondering if the fantastic tale might not be, as Leroux claimed until his death, grounded in fact.

Perhaps my favorite thing about the novel, however, is Leroux's use of music as symbolism. Every piece of music mentioned by name in the novel is symbolic of something in the plot. Gounod's Faust, which underscores the entire story, tells the tale of a man who sells his soul to the devil for the love of a beautiful woman - certainly a parallel to the doomed love the Phantom holds for Christine Daaé. Other musical selections act as foreshadow. For example, ""Danse Macabre (Dance of Death),"" played at the gala in the second chapter, seems to herald the arrival of the Red Death at the masquerade ball.

All in all, Leroux's novel is, I would say, a masterpiece. With an ingenious story, tied together with beautiful descriptions, often witty dialogue, and sympathetic characters. It is perhaps one of the only ""classic"" novels I know which contains a morally grey antagonist whose victims pity, rather than despise, him. While ""Le fantôme de l'opéra"" didn't sell well upon publication and was, in fact, out of print for several years, the popularity of the story speaks to the brilliance of Leroux's vision. I would advise everyone, particularly fans of the musical, to give this novel a try. For those who don't know, the famous musical ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is based off of this book. I can tell you first-hand that that musical is a lifetime experience. The performance has been made into a movie, even.
It does not matter in what order you read this book, see the show live or watch the movie. You don't have to do them all, but each gives a different perspective.

The book ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a classic love story, but far more complex than just that. The writing style is slightly awkward in this day and age, and the translations from the original (in French, I believe) are above average. Despite this, the style hints of the past, which it takes place in (1875ish). Also, there are no obvious spelling errors or any peculiar phrases that you can find in books of this day and age today.

In an Opera Populaire, there are rumors and fears of a ghost, Opera Ghost, or O.G. He is said to be everywhere but found nowhere. This ghost causes no disturbance as long as his demands are met--a salary, Box 5 left empty, and Christine Daae to sing onstage every now and then.
But of course, the owners won't have any of it. They don't believe in the supernatural..
And neither does Christine's lover (""boyfriend""), Raoul. Until, of course, Christine herself tells him.
But what she actually tells him is what the story's about.

The Phantom, as he's known in the movie, loves Christine. He has been the one teaching her to sing after her gifted violinist father died. Christine, however, has never seen the Opera Ghost until he kidnaps her, wanting to be with her forever. He wears a mask to cover his disfigured face, and because of his malformations his own mother feared him. The Phantom has never known compassion, and doesn't know how to express himself to Christine. He has only ever known violence, and this is evident as he meanwhile threatens and murders, and brings down a chandelier during a performance.

Christine's heart, however, is to Raoul instead. Raoul seeks killing the Phantom, who would do anything for Christine.

Now, let me draw the line here between the show and movie, and the book. The show/movie is solidly based off the book, but does NOT follow it. The musical is just as good as the book (a rare occurrence in this world), but the book is more... descriptive. In a violent way. Both are definitely without a doubt PG 13+, but the more gruesome screens and dark moods lie in the book instead.

Book (as violent as it gets): People die, bodies are found (no solid description of them), there's a Torture Chamber which drives a few people to insanity, a gun, gruesome descriptions of The Phantom, a few people almost drown, kidnapping, supernatural power-y stuff. There is no sexual content beyond a PG 13 level. A very creepy tone, not recommended for ages below 15.

Movie/show (as bad as it gets): People die in violent manners (two hangings), a gun, The Phantom with his disfigured face, mild sexual content, not-so-much-kidnapping-but-still-there, supernatural power-y stuff, and that's really about it. More of a life lesson story, has a lighter and more inspiring tone to it. To be honest here, there's no specific age level I'd recommend, instead I'd simply say the show/movie is for the mature only. A few lyrics are opera too, and hard to understand, so factor that as well.

Movie is about 2 hours, plus another 40 minutes if you watch Andrew Lloyd Webber give a speech and all the original cast sing. The book is just under 200 pages. The show: plan on 4 total there. If not more.

I am greatly obsessed with The Phantom of the Opera and immensely enjoyed the book and movie. Today, it's THE best musical you can see, better than Wicked, Camelot, etc.

Now, whenever something happens in my house,
""He's there, the Phantom of the Operaaaaaaaaa!"" Good! It’s a nice paperback, and quite cheap. The cover is simple, yet nice. Very good quality. Obra clássica, ambientada em Paris e sucesso na Broadway. Recomendado para quem gosta de histórias que misturam ficção com locações reais. I’ve always loved the musical by Andrew loyd Webber , so I’ve finally decided to read the original story! Well, if you cried for the play don’t expect any relief in this ! Dark , passionate,intriguing,sad,thrilling...but sublime like only the angel of music can be ! たいへん読みやすく、「オペラ座の怪人」ファンとして、一度は読んでおきたい一冊です。 Het blijft een mooi en meeslepend verhaal"
The Odyssey (AmazonClassics Edition),"After enduring the Trojan War, Odysseus begins the treacherous journey home to Ithaca. On the way, he faces ravenous monsters and vengeful gods. But the real battle awaits, as his kingdom is under siege by unruly suitors vying for his wife’s hand—and his son’s head. To reclaim his throne and save his family, Odysseus must rely on his wits…and help from the unpredictable gods.
Homer’s The Odyssey was composed around 700 BC. It is one of the earliest epics in existence and remains one of the most influential works of literature today.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Odyssey, this edition of The Odyssey (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Homer's Odysseus is a vitally basic work of world literature, but oh, so confusing as reading experience. Over ten years ago I read a poem-version Finnish translversi of it in a reading group. Notes from that and these are like made from two different books. In the Finnish translation Greek-derived names of people and gods has been used, here instead Latin-based. This in itself is confusing for the inconvenience, until you get used to it. Another difference is thitinstead verse translation and this outspoken, yet somehow poetic-bound unusual prose text.
The work and activity, the general course of events is quite clear, as long as it is kept in mind that they are not told as events as they occur, but afterwardas as a travel account. Here a terrible number of people and gods are included. Only a limited number of activities and a vague impression of the importance of things fasten in mind. When reading you cannot avoid comparing life now and then. Odyssian life seems to be concentrated to more essential things than is our life. Just eating, drinking, dressing, and homemaking get more attention than in our life. All the action is in every respect more grandiose than it is now. People are gathered in big numbers. Whole pigs will be eaten, a lot of washing, rough behavior. Fighting for petty reasons, ruthless killing, but also generous treating: clothes, lavish gifts are given.
The difference in the relationship between man and god is really great. This of course, because of the fundamental difference between the polytheistic and monotheistic religions. We have only one God who is behind everything and decides everything perfectly. Ulysse's gods are many and they are dedicated to specific issues. There are contradictions between the gods and not just between people and in human relations to the gods. But the gods are also closer to the people and behave like people. While here man is created as image of God, Odyssian gods are vice versa enlarged pictures of man.
Are there any books to which this unique story could be compared? Yes, to similar works of polytheistic worldview, such as the Kalevala, which also describes a journey, Sampo robbery and acquiring it back to its original use as the source of general well-being. Because the world of the Kalevala is more human and refined, it is in my eyes more appealing than the heights of mountains and jagged environments of Odyssean world.
Although the plot is clear and justified, a question remains: Why does not Odysseus straight away go to meet Penelope? So would a hero of our world undoubtedly have done.
However, no way avoiding full five stars, mainly for the clarity and great features of the plot. This work is a classic, of course. It is written in a way that is different than what we've become accustomed to; that too is clear. It is so refreshing to read a book like that. The typical formulaic approach we see in today's books is absent as is the bad language and poor use of English. The book is not for the simple-minded. That said, I wish there were more people who could truly appreciate a classic like this. I agree with other reviewers who were distracted by the Kindle presentation that strung the iambic pentameter couplets into paragraphs and distorted the poetic structure of the tale. Once I got into the sense and rhythm of the story, however, the appearance became less important than the substance of Homer's epic. This version of the Odyssey is a translation by English poet Alexander Pope, first published in 1726. It has a Shakespearean quality to it that, for me, captures the feel of something ancient, but universal. The introductory summary for each of the 24 ""Arguments"" helped to clarify some of the confusion that would otherwise exist in the subsequent text. Pope's frequent use of Roman names for the gods of a singularly Greek world bothered me some, but probably should be allowed the benefit of poetic license. I was overwhelmed by the ability of Homer (through Pope) to capture the violence of the climactic exaction of Ulysses' revenge. All in all, a tale well told, deserving of its place in classic literature, and certainly worth the time spent reading and enjoying it. Point: All the perils, deception, and monsters in the ancient world could not keep the hero Ulysses from returning to his home after the destruction of Troy.

Path: Homer takes the reader on an epic adventure through the Greek world of ships, storms, gods, and battle. Set in poetic verse, this ancient rhyme rings of man's life in the shadow of the gods. At times they smile upon the finite man, and at others they seek to crush his frail existence.

Agreement: This was an exciting story, told with great descriptions and flowing words. The arrangement of story told and retold added to the suspense of the adventure.

Disagreement: The dated english mixed with the various names of greek gods made it difficult to follow all the conversations. The format of this kindle book also made it harder since the poetry was reduced to rhyming paragraphs.

Favorite Quotes: ""Beauty unchaste is beauty in disgrace."" ""Be thy soul at rest; and know, whatever heaven ordains is best."" ""Of all the ills unhappy mortals know, a life of wanderings is the greatest woe.""

It would be worth another read and I would recommend it.

*I would recommend listening to Josh Garrel's song, Ulysses, after reading this. My children tell me this poem is not required reading in school any longer, but then it wasn't when I was in high school in the 1970's either. Western Civ was crammed into a semester. Understand who and what you are in an hour a day over a term. Yeah I am sure that is going to work out. But I got a drivers license and that at least identified my gender.

Otherwise lost in this age I decided to go back to the beginning, and like our hero depart this never never land the nymph Calypso tells me I am in where all is beautiful and there is no mortality. Ulysses knows who he is and leaves, preferring humanity.

In contrast we are unmoored from all we have been before. We have no epic mythology that tells us who we are. Instead we are informed by the cyclops television, desktop computer or smart phone. How reliable are the stories these things tell live by?

What I learned from Ulysses was I had the power to sharpen a stick and poke these monsters in the eye. Then set sail for Ithaca. Written by Homer, which in Ancient Greek means ""the man who cannot see"", The Odyssey is one of the best books written in ancient times, and is a mixture of Mythology and History. Based on an historical event, such as the war between the Greeks and the city of Troy, The Odyssey is about the journey which Ulysses underwent to go back from Troy to his island, Ithaca, where his wife and family was waiting for him.
The war against Troy took 10 years to end, and Ulysses will need another ten years to go back home in a series of adventures. The Book provides a good idea of human beings' life, feelings and habits in the centuries before Christ. No comment An all time classic and must read Lectura clásica es gratis y es buena. Deberían aprovechar y leer estos libros que marcan un hito en la escritura. Like all other old classic authors... superb!"
The Great Gatsby (AmazonClassics Edition),"Four years after the Great War, America is enjoying an economic boom. Enigmatic veteran Jay Gatsby, who’s risen from being nobody from nowhere to self-made millionaire, is along for the ride. Upwardly mobile, he reaches for status among the “old money” on Long Island—and for all that it promises across the bay, namely Daisy, the lost love of his youth, who has been married for five years to Gatsby’s contemptible rival, Tom Buchanan. With all his wealth and charmed aspirations to restore the past, Gatsby is certain he can win her back. But halfway between the skyscrapers of Manhattan and the mansions of West Egg lies the “valley of ashes,” where Gatsby’s glittering world is turned upside down.
The Great Gatsby remains the quintessential embodiment of the reckless idealism of the Jazz Age and the disenchanting search for the American Dream.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Great Gatsby, this edition of The Great Gatsby (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Reviewing ""The Great Gatsby"" feels a bit presumptuous and for sure somehow redundant. What can one say that has not been said already about this seminal story?
To avoid being totally repetitive I will start with some personal perspective. I read this book the first time as a teenager in my native Bucharest, at a time when I knew little about life in general and almost nothing about New York or United States. When I finished reading, I was left with the impression that this was about some people quarreling after a car accident. What a difference 40 years make. Reading it now, I felt great empathy for the plight of the characters and I believe I recognized at least some of the universal themes pursued by the author. It seems to me that Fitzgerald advances here a very pessimistic premise about people's behavior and what they can expect from life, namely that those who are self-absorbed or just selfish will always end up better off than those who, in pursuit of valid or absurd dreams, insist on fighting the reality on behalf of their dreams.

As we follow the story, Gatsby's dream of recapturing the lost love of his youth, Myrtle's dream of becoming a respectable bourgeois matron, Wilson's dream of being a successful business owner, all become vehicles for the ultimate destruction of those who dream them. In the meantime the monumentally insensitive Tom and the cowardly shallow Daisy continue to prosper in the big city, not perturbed in the least by their heavy responsibility for what has just happened. Learning his lesson, the narrator, Nick , gives up on his dream of becoming a well-adjusted East Coast money man and decides to go back home to Mid-West.

Some people will see here a class contrast element. After all, Tom and Daisy are rich while their unintended victims are low or lower class. I believe that the essence of the story transcends class. In my experience, people like Tom and Daisy can be found in all strata of society, irrespective of income or status.

The pleasure of reading this book is enhanced by Scott Fitzgerald wonderful gift for using little details like a gesture, a word, a simple noise or a clever comment by the narrator in order to bring depth to his characters and advance the story. ""The Great Gatsby"" effortlessly transports us to the ""roaring twenties"" in New York City, a time and place of great optimism and sudden prosperity for many. The author viewpoint is less rosy. He spots human frailty and suffering even in the middle of the most lavish settings. In a symbolic way, Daisy's car crash portends historical events still to come. Ability to prophesize aside, Fitzgerald remains himself a product of the era. Within the story, he casually stereotypes Jews as shadowy money grubbing characters with hairs coming out of their noses and he is not above using variations of the ""n"" word when he thinks necessary. No matter; this is a remarkable novel, one of those ten or twenty essential books that everyone should read before claiming they know anything about human nature. I highly recommend it. Well.. it took me a few chapters to get into this but once I had a sense of who the narrator was I was able to fully commit myself to his life and what was going on and I absolutely fell in love.

What a dramatic story! A tale full of love, loss, regret, fear, and just plain craziness. In short it has all of the emotions of real life all rolled up into one little tale about a man! It’s the telling of this man’s life story from a friend’s perspective and it was so unique, and written so well that I really did not want to put this down.

Every character woven so dramatically around each others lives that the reader is left begging for more!

The thing about this story is that you can feel the love from Gatsby as he agonizes over Daisy and every movement she makes. More than once my heart ached for him and I was curious and not very optimistic about how this story was going to end. But it was written so beautifully and harmonically that I just could not find myself leaving this story alone. And I know this is going to be one of my favs for years to come.

I then immediately watched the movie. And how engrossed I was! The music, the tone, the performances, and add all that to the fact that the speech was nearly perfect to the book. This is one movie that I can say definitively, if you like the book, you’ll love the movie! Although I loved the fact that it was spot on, I also loved the cinematography. It was so graphically done, very reminiscent of The Moulin Rouge with scandalous attire, fabulous music, and wonderful plots! I was not surprised to find that Baz Luhrmann wrote both stories because I could just feel the exoticness in everything that was done, and loved it! My granddaughter was very happy with the great Gatsby. As a retired professor of English writing and literature, I have always loved this book and reread it every couple of years. This time, having recently again seen the DiCaprio film of The Great Gatsby, and owning the earlier version with Robert Redford and Sam Waterston, I decided to reread it and decide which film is the better treatment of this classic American novel (some would say the best American novel). Without doubt, the Redford version is better, in part because of the more faithful treatment of Fitzgerald's novel and more use of his exact stunning language, and in part because of Waterston's excellent portrayal of narrator Nick Carraway. Redford makes the tragic hero glimmer from within as well as with the golden aura of his money, while Mia Farrow is appropriately insipid as Daisy, ""a beautiful little fool"" as she says regarding her daughter's birth. While I enjoy Luhrmann's films, I think in his version of Gatsby, there is a bit too much Luhrmann and too little F. Scott. However, read the book, watch both films, and make your own decision! I also strongly recommend reading Frances Kroll Ring's biography of the last years of F. Scott Fitzgerald's life during which time she was his secretary, Against the Current. A truly intriguing read from one who was there until the end. I do not like this book. It's too wordy and deranged. I detest the narrator immeasurably. But since it's a ""classic,"" I've tried to finish it just to be able to say I did. Well, now I've finished it, and I can finally rid myself of the opulent selfishness of every character. Ugh. I loved the quality of the writing and the quiet impending sense of doom. So very, very enjoyable I would recommend this book to anyone who thinks about the porpoise of our existence and how thrilling and tragic it can be. Good Not bad, but given all the raving reviews I felt it was overrated. Tengo que admitir que aún no lo he terminado de leer. Lo elegí por recomendación de un amigo y lo estoy leyendo en inglés por aquello de leer los libros en versión original. Estoy aprendiendo muchas expresiones del ambiente de la alta sociedad americana de aquel entonces y las descripciones y narración del libro son muy envolventes y a menudo con toques muy buenos de originalidad.

Se lo recomiendo a quien quiera dejarse querer por el ambiente vanal aristocrático que por el momento acompaña a la historia. Creo que merece la pena leerlo. (No he visto las películas)."
The Secret Garden (AmazonClassics Edition),"The orphaned Mary Lennox is sullen, ill tempered, and unloved when she’s sent to live with her uncle, Archibald Craven. A man consumed by grief over the death of his wife, Archibald has allowed his sprawling estate on the moors to fall into grim disrepair. It’s when Mary begins tending to her late aunt’s mysterious garden—locked up and neglected for years—that she discovers its life-changing secrets and a flowering rejuvenation of the human spirit.
Out of this dark, closed-off world and a child’s innate curiosity about life and death comes one of the most transformative coming-of-age novels ever written.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Secret Garden, this edition of The Secret Garden (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Just perfect full of surprises and how nature gardening and believing in yourself and magic can change your world. Nature is the best healer and great uplifting story that will change how you view your garden and life. Great for all ages The physical copy I ordered has been sent to a loved one. I maintain an old copy at home and just finished rereading this tale on Kindle, as my situation allows. It had been almost 4 decades since I ventured forth with Miss Mary onto the grounds discovering life in all its glory and more than one secret along the way. What an adventure it has been once again. Only this time, a bit more seasoned, I made a discovery I had not made when younger. The truth of the secret garden. What it truly is, where to find it, and then what to do with it. These are the real secrets hidden within this gem of a novel and timeless tale. Told in a way that can appeal to every age. I highly recommend this book to everyone! I never read ‘The Secret Garden’ as a child, nor any of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s books. Now in my second childhood, this was, therefore, my first encounter and I enjoyed the read even if there are failings from a writer’s perspective in the 21st century.

However, as I started reading I found the descriptions and characterisations were pulling me into a secret world. The author had a way of using short phrases to capture a sense of the characters and settings. Maybe the technique would be hard to replicate today, but it worked in the context of the novel and the period in which it is set. This was a time before the First World War for both characters and author. This may explain a certain innocence that two world wars dispelled.

Locked into the words and images, I was drawn deeper into Mary's world and her explorations. Robin was a cute character that felt almost human in his mannerisms. Some might say anthropomorphic - Anthropomorphism is the attribution of human traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities – but for me, the characteristics fitted the bird I knew from growing up in England. He becomes the character that ‘unlocks’ the secret garden and the healing that Mary and others need.

When she was in the garden, I could see it and sense it. Some might feel that Dickon is unreal and yet he came alive for me, first in what his sister Martha said about him and then when Mary met him. I’ve been lucky that I have known a few special people like him and the character echoed memories of those that have a rapport with wild animals.

When Mary found the source of the crying, the book added another character and another level. Damaged characters and healing is a theme from the start of the novel, but it’s the secret garden that’s the catalyst. I liked all the interactions between the characters, and the use of mirror images that Mary and others must face to grow.

When Spring arrived, there was magic is in the air. That is what makes this book work for me and why I suspect that it still survives alongside other children’s classics. Frances Hodgson Burnett captures that feeling of magic that in many ways exist in the natural world around us. There are elements that felt wrong to me reading in 2017, but omniscient POV, idealised social situations, and outdated attitudes were, unfortunately, the norm when the novel was written so they didn’t spoil my enjoyment – just deducted one star as a writer with a conscience. But that star magically re-appeared. Despite being a voracious reader, there are some books considered ""children's classics"" that I have never read. I decided to rectify this recently by picking up ""The Secret Garden."" I was somewhat familiar with the story, as I'd watched a film adaptation of the story at one point, but am fully aware that books and their movies can often be vastly different. So though I could predict certain things about the story as I read, I still found it an enjoyable read... even if it isn't my favorite book, and certain elements felt strange in their inclusion, especially towards the end.

""The Secret Garden"" follows Mary, a spoiled and unlikable young girl and the daughter of a British officer living in India. When her parents die of a terrible sickness, she's shuttled off to England to live with a reclusive uncle, and finds herself lost and alone in the gloomy manor. But as she sets out to explore her new home and make sense of this strange new land, she discovers the titular secret garden -- a garden that has been locked up since her aunt died in a tragic accident ten years ago. Enchanted by the garden, Mary sets out to tend it and bring it back to life, aided by a grouchy gardener, a soft-hearted animal-loving boy named Dickon... and Colin, a cousin who has been locked inside all his life and treated like an invalid. The garden turns out to be just the thing both Mary and Colin need to revitalize themselves... and it just may finally bring healing to a family long broken by tragedy...

""The Secret Garden"" is an enchanting novel, told with an almost fairy-tale-like language that evokes the sights, sounds, and smells of the English moors and gardens and their inhabitants. The writing style is lovely, and paints clear pictures in the mind. The heavy Yorkshire accents of certain characters can be tricky at times, but I managed anyhow. And while Dickon as a character feels a little too good to be true, almost straying into Mary-Sue territory, it's nice to see Mary and Colin develop as the book goes in, gaining confidence in themselves and shedding some of the selfishness and bad temper their sheltered lives have given them.

The biggest flaw, in my opinion, is that the book strays into a weird fantasy/magical-realism realm toward the end, which I feel wasn't foreshadowed very well. I love fantasy and don't mind magical realism, but it felt out of place here, especially with Colin going on about studying ""magic"" while at the same time declaring he wants to be a scientist. It just felt odd to me, and while it might be a product of its time (this book IS over a century old), it did taint my enjoyment somewhat.

Still, complaints aside, I can easily see why ""The Secret Garden"" enjoys a reputation as a children's classic. It's not the best children's novel I've ever read, but I enjoyed it, and am glad I gave it a chance. Perhaps I'll pick up the author's other classic, ""A Little Princess,"" sometime in the near future... Es una edición preciosa y de calidad. La encuadernación es una maravilla, las páginas son gruesas y el formato hace que sea muy cómodo de leer. Las ilustraciones, aunque algo escasas para mi gusto, son una delicia.
La historia me ha parecido algo aburrida y lenta al principio pero al final ha resultado ser muy bonita. Además, usa un lenguaje bastante sencillo por lo que es fácil de comprender con un nivel intermedio de inglés. Solo hay algunas partes en las que usan algo así como un dialecto y al principio es algo complicado, pero se va entendiendo más a medida que avanza el libro. 西村書店版「秘密の花園」の原書。

本書はイギリス・ロンドンの古本屋から発送されました。簡単に外国の本が入手できるアマゾンさんに感謝感謝。 Wydanie bardzo w porządku. Zapach kartek bezcenny. القصه تختلف قليلا عن النسخه المدرسية The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett is a classic children's novel that weaves themes of resilience, friendship, and the healing power of nature into an enchanting story.
The book follows Mary Lennox, a spoiled and lonely child who is sent to live with her uncle at Misselthwaite Manor in England after her parents' death. Initially sour and self-centered, Mary discovers a hidden, neglected garden on the estate. As she begins to nurture the garden back to life, she undergoes a personal transformation, becoming kinder, more empathetic, and filled with purpose.
Mary's interactions with Dickon, a nature-loving boy, and Colin, her sickly and reclusive cousin, form the heart of the story. Together, they explore the wonders of the garden, which becomes a metaphor for their emotional and physical healing. Burnett beautifully captures the innocence of childhood and the restorative power of the natural world.
The novel’s rich descriptions of the Yorkshire moors and the garden itself create a vivid and immersive setting. While some of the language and cultural attitudes reflect the time it was written (1911), the core message of growth, renewal, and the importance of human connection remains timeless.
Strengths:
Engaging and memorable characters.
Lush, evocative descriptions of nature.
A heartwarming story of personal growth and friendship.
Weaknesses:
Some dated language and perspectives.
A slower pace that might not appeal to all modern readers.
Overall, The Secret Garden is a delightful read for both children and adults, offering a timeless reminder of the beauty that can be found in the world around us—and within ourselves."
Persuasion (AmazonClassics Edition),"Seven years ago, Anne Elliot broke off her engagement to Captain Frederick Wentworth, convinced that marrying a man without money or status would be a grave mistake. Now, she is past her prime and single at twenty-seven. But when the estranged paramours reconnect through a couple renting the Elliot family estate, Anne discovers she may have another shot at romance—this time, on her terms.
Part fairy tale, part social commentary, Jane Austen’s novel delivers not only her signature warmth and wit but perhaps her most mature and relatable heroine. Persuasion remains true to Austen’s form in being ahead of its time, arguing that where there is love, there is happiness—even in the most impractical of unions.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Persuasion, this edition of Persuasion (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Persuasion was Jane Austen's final novel. It is often criticized for being too short and not up to par with Austen's other novels. Persuasion was in fact written during the onset of the disease that eventually killed the author. Her final novel may indeed be considered different from her previous novels. It is the only Austen novel where the female protagonist is close to becoming a spinster. Persuasion is a very different type of novel with a love story told in retrospect, an unexpected villain, and an unintentional, but very bad piece of advice that negatively impacts many lives.

The main protagonist in this book is Anne Elliot. Anne is the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot. Sir Elliot was once a man of property and weath, but his ostentatious manner of living has considerably dimished his fortune. The great Elliot family retain only a much respected name and a fine estate named Kellynch Hall. Sir Walter is forced to confront his inability to retain the standard of living once enjoyed at the estate. He is asked to consider many options, including trimming down the number of servants, but all options seem appalling to the proud Sir Elliot.

Under the advice of a family friend, Sir Elliot agrees to let Kellynch Hall and retire to Bath with his eldest and middle daughter. Sir Elliot is not the only one in the family who takes the advice of the much respected Lady Russell, a widow and friend of the deceased Lady Elliot.

Anne Elliot was once engaged and very much in love with a poor, but honorable naval officer named Frederick Wentworth. Anne, however, broke off the engagement after Lady Russell convinced her that it would be a grave mistake for a young lady of her station to marry someone so far beneath her.

Eight lonely years go by for Anne, and the years have not been kind to her. The author writes that her beauty has considerably dimished. One who may have known Anne years ago would hardly find her recognizable. Over the years, Anne has forced herself not to think ""of that person"" as Anne often refers to Frederick Wentworth. The reader is immediately aware of Anne's lingering feelings for the man she heartlessly and foolishly rejected.

She is forced to confront her feelings when the family that leases Kellynch Hall turn out to be relations of now wealthy Captain Wentworth. There is much awkwardness and dread as Anne prepares to face the man she once loved and let go. Captain Wenworth, however, appears indifferent and one would hardly suspect from his cold behavior towards Anne that the two were ever even acquainted!

Throughout the novel Anne desperately looks for and finds small little details in Captain Wentworth behavior that the love he had for her has not diminished entirely. But can he forgive her for snubbing him?

I absolutely adored this novel about the one who got away, but there is so much more to the story than just Anne and Captain Wentworth. The book is full of lively characters, such as Anne's pompous father, her self-indulgent sister, Elizabeth, and many others. Most people are aquainted with Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Emma, but Persuasion should be recognized for the fine novel that it is. ""Persuasion"" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.

This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as ""Pride and Prejudice"" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book ""Pride and Prejudice"" you should give this one a try.

Our herione ""Anne Elliot"" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called ""Kellylynch Hall"" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.

Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.

Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?

Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon.

This edition includes a chapter that was omitted in the completed version, it was kind of a first draft option and Jane Austen chose another scene instead. I don't know if other versions of this book have that chapter. It was interesting to see the alternative ideas Jane Austen had. Ein toller Klassiker sehr empfehlenswert Really good book! It arrived in a great condition and it arrived within a few days of ordering it!!! penguin kalitesi ve muhtesem bir kitap Molto si è detto e scritto sulle opere di Jane Austen, che tutt'oggi è una scrittrice tra le più amate. In questo come negli altri suoi romanzi, i personaggi e l'ambiente sono finemente cesellati dalla sua mano talentuosa e dalla sua inconfondibile grazia. I am not a Jane Austen's fan (but may be persuaded to become one after this book). Beyond her Pride and Prejudice, I have never read another novel by Jane Austen until now. I was curious about Persuasion because it was featured in the film called the Lake House. In it, it was described as ""a really depressing story"" with two people loving each other at different times. Because I would like to discover how Persuasion was similar to the Lake House, so I bought the book. Once I started reading it, I could not put it down, and I realise that the impression of the book given in the Lake House can't be more wrong - so much so that I wonder if the script writer of the film had ever read the book!

The charm of this book perhaps is difficult to rationalise - it is predictable, life portrayed is glossy and far removed from our everyday life with a lifestyle closer to today's billionaires perhaps, characters are polarised, and really it is about ripples in a tea cup. In terms of storyline, it shares a lot of similarities with Pride and Prejudice. For example, both Mr Darcy and Captain Wentworth had their offers rejected once, and were tormented by it thereafter (for longer in Captain Wentworth's case). Both Elisabeth and Anne had silly parents and siblings who could not understand or see their silliness, and often betrayed propriety. Both families had no heir and financial future of the girls was uncertain, with their respective cousins set to inherit their family estate. There was a villain, who was charming and deceptive to the whole community but was really after money with no conscience and no heart. And truths were discovered and revealed by a series of coincidences, eavesdropping and grapevines.

When I started on the book, I thought, ""Here we go again."" But soon, I was drawn into it. Although I was anticipating the encounters of Captain Wentworth and Anne, the expectation did not dampen the excitement and curiosity of how each time would turn out for them. When they started to reason with the thoughts and feelings, one could not help but fall in love with the characters gradually. Captain Wentworth in particular was a man in pain. He was truthful to his emotions, and did not hide (from Anne's perception) that he was struggling to understand them, deal with them, and move on from them. As such, he was a real person and really endearing. When Captain Wentworth came to his reckoning but was not in a position to act on it, it must have been an agony for him. This conflict was transpired only at the very end but it was all very convincing. Part of the suspense of the book was about why Captain Wentworth did or did not do certain things - what was he thinking and how was he feeling? Anne had her guesses all the way through, as the story was really told from Anne's perspective, but we are never sure. In fact, at times, even Anne was confused. How the story is told therefore sets up Captain Wentworth as an enigma. This special effect to some extent compensates Jane Austen's approach to men in her books, that is, men were always as perceived by ladies. Also Anne's sharp perception of Captain Wentworth's thinking filled some of the gaps that this approach may leave. The only time when Captain Wentworth was allowed to speak for himself was right at the end. His side of the story came out when Anne and he had their heart-to-heart after ""the"" letter. At that point, you smile and sigh a relief of joy, so refreshing is to have the male's point of view!

The character of Anne, on the other hand, was slightly insipid, I thought. She was not like Elisabeth Bennett who was witty, sharp, and archly. Her virtues of good nature, kindness, tenderness and level-headedness took much longer to convince. Perhaps it is because there were not many situations which showed off her qualities. Her narratives however showed her sharp perception of situation, and her understanding of Captain Wentworth in particular. It is puzzling how she was slighted by her family and other relatives, but it is something we take it as given.

Finally the success of the book must be in Jane Austen's skills as a writer. I was amazed how detailed her description was - a glance, a look, a gesture, the body language, all are laid out open for the eyes of a keen observer - there are a lot of subtleties in the book. Her prose is mesmerising and makes characters and drama come to life by igniting our imagination. I think the scene where Captain Wentworth was eavesdropping the conversation between Anne and Captain Harville which prompted him to write the letter to Anne bursting with his feelings is particularly tender, dramatic and well-structured. The context made the letter mean so much more, as he was really the third person in that conversation without the knowledge of the two people who were conversing at the time. While outwardly, everything was under control and restraint, inwardly he could not hold on any longer. The contrast between the heartfelt and explosive contents of the letter and the outward silence and distance between Anne and Captain Wentworth made a cinematic contrast, which is memorable. When all the analysis is done, and justification for our opinion laid down, what remains totally undeniable is our reading experience, the fact that it is a page-turner with your heart pounding even though you know what is going to come."
The Art of War (AmazonClassics Edition),"Long considered the most essential treatise on military strategy and tactics, The Art of War comprises thirteen chapters, each dedicated to a different aspect of warfare. Reaching far beyond the battlefield, it is a manifesto for success in every kind of conflict or competition, having had a notable influence on various subjects such as law, sports, and interpersonal relationships.
In this definitive 1910 Lionel Giles translation, the celebrated sinologist’s interpretive notes and valuable commentary make clear the nuances of Sun Tzu’s language. Most critical, Giles provides the context and culture from which the general’s theories emerged.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Art of War, this edition of The Art of War (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. ""The Art of War” is the masterpiece book of war strategy by Sun Tzu. Sun Tzu (“Master Sun”) lived in China about 500 BC and was perhaps the first theoretician of war. In his 13-chapter treatise “The Art of War,” Sun Tzu viewed an army as merely the instrument that dealt the death blow to an enemy previously made vulnerable. Before outright war, secret agents separated the enemy from its allies by subversive operations: spreading false rumors and misleading information, corrupting and subverting officials, nurturing fifth columns (groups within a country at war who work for or sympathize with its enemies), fomenting internal discord, and observing the results with spies. Only when one could not overcome the enemy was there a resort to armed force. One applied such force to gain victory: 1. in the shortest time, 2. at the least cost in lives and effort, and 3. by inflicting the fewest enemy casualties. Sun Tzu did not believe the goal of military action was the destruction of the enemy’s army, cities, and countryside. “Weapons are ominous tools to be used only when there is no alternative.”

Among the more than forty English translations of “Art of War,” Dr. Giles’ work, first published in 1910, is quite good, as judged by John F. Sullivan, retired U.S. Army China Foreign Area Officer. The book, as offered in this edition, comes very close to including all commentary in Giles’ original translation as provided by Bob Sutton’s online commentary in Project Gutenberg. Furthermore, as Sutton says,

The Giles’ edition of ‘Art of War’ is a scholarly work. A leading sinologue at the time, Dr. Giles was an assistant in the Department of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts in the British Museum. He desired to produce the definitive edition of Sun Tzu’s work. For 50 years, it was the best translation and still the most scholarly, presenting the reader with an incredible amount of information concerning Sun Tzu’s text.

A minor comment: The reader might find the book’s frequent backgrounder use of the “ssu-ma” appellation a little confusing. Ssu-ma (or Sima) is the surname of a Chinese family/clan devoted to serving the Emperor by giving war advice. The family name henceforth became almost generic, taking on the meaning of “military official in ancient China.” The term “Ssu-ma Fa” equates to “The Methods of the Ssu-ma.” Also of potential interest, the often-quoted Ssu-ma Ch'ien (surname first, given name second) is the same person as Sima Qian, the “Grand Historian or Herodotus of China,"" who lived around 100 BC, some 400 years after Sun Tzu and about whom he comments.

While some readers might prefer other versions of Giles’ work, some stripped to only Sun Tzu quotes, many will find this version perfect and price-worthy in that it allows the reader full access to background information, some to be skipped, with much to be savored to fully illuminate the exact meaning of Sun Tzu’s advice. Highly recommended for any library on strategy.

If interested in more information about strategy, consider reading the following book which distills and integrates the works of 87 master strategists (Sun Tzu included): I know this is a very important book that everyone should read. I'll be honest, by the end of it, I felt stupider than I was when I started it. That is my failing, not the books. I did get some stuff out of this. For me, it was a bit of a struggle. But I know it's a good book. Is said that poetry is the way in which words, like ancient magic, transmits a precise knowledge, a truth, in such a way that symbol and meaning are almost the same. This work by Sun Tzu feels like poetry as it goes to the essence of the human being as a creature that attempts enterprises. Sun Tzu has bequeathed us a short book that is classical in the sense that its immortality is confirmed by the fact that it doesn't matter in which century you read it, it is not outdated. Is universal because it doesn't matter your race, gender, occupation or beliefs: ""The Art of War"" is illuminating. It lights up deep truths about the way we have to behave in order to win. It is a fundamental reading, the sooner you read it the better : )

AmazonClassics Edition are the best for works written in English language. They offer the text in its purity, with X-Ray and excellent formatting. Sadly for their books written in another languages they rely on translations already in the public domain. This means that is a question of luck to have a good translation, in the case of ""The Art of War"" the problem is that the translator, Lionel Giles, gives a poorly organized introduction with duplicate and, to be blunt, boring data. Fortunately afterwards he has the good taste to put the text pure without commentary. It is a good translation with few outdated words. But it adds then the same text with a commentary that is pointless, only an exercise of vanity, because it explains what is already crystal clear, save a couple of data all is, for our century, already outdated. I'd love if Amazon would allow us to delete pages and chapters so this perfect book could not be mutilated with unnecessary additions. For this book I think the AmazonClassics Edition, despite its good presentation, is not the best one. ""The Art of War"" is an interesting book. I say this because while it is clearly a product of its time, i.e., very much rooted in ancient warfare, the book offers some timeless lessons, that are applicable both to personal and business circumstances, even in modern times. I particularly liked the ancient way of analyzing the battleground and how to choose battles. Reiterating my take, it's an interesting read. I'm giving it a three though as it still has its limitations and not all of the advice in the book can be applied to modern situations, some even controversial like the sending of spies. I’ve given this book 5 stars simply because it’s passed the test of time and is still very relevant however I am saddened by the tear at the bottom of the books spine...I’ve decided to purchase more books than movies because I hope my children and future decedents can physically hold a story and read the very same words that define me. To pass on wisdom although I’m a fool...and I’m uneasy because the bottom of the spine of this masterpiece is weekend by someone packaging my purchase...and I hope this book lives far longer than me...but based on the way it was received....I fear that it will not last past my own lifetime... I had heard of Sun Tzu and the art of war but never read it. I found this to be interesting and well done. Not my normal type of book but well worth reading. The book is amazing if you tried to reflect these strategies on your day to day things to do. If u don't reflect, things will look too complex to understand for someone who never read about war things and strategies. Recomendo Ive seen & heard it quoted in everything from text books to comics.
This is the first time ive read it uninterupted
No wonder it is revered
A brilliant mind!! The concepts presented are very interesting. The book seems to be in two parts with the first being fairly short and to the point and the second being an expansion. Because I had understood the first part I skipped the second. A book I've always wanted to read. Para toda etapa de la vida te ayudará a afrontar las dificultades Dieses Buch wurde von unserem Professor empfohlen für Strategisches Kommunikationsmanagement und ist sehr interessant zu lesen."

Revised edition: Previously published as Sense and Sensibility, this edition of Sense and Sensibility (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I’m re-reading Jane Austen’s works to commemorate her 260th birthday year 2025.
I’ve started with Sense and Sensibility as her first published work and going through in order of publishing.
I love this book and her ability to tell a great story while making comments on disparities of her times. Just read, and enjoy! If you have only seen the movies, please get this beautiful edition to acquaint yourself, or if you have read it, reacquaint yourself with this wonderful story. I had not read Sense and Sensibility for many years and recently decided to curl up one afternoon with this edition. I was amazed at how much I had forgotten: this was not just the story of the two Dashwood sisters who were so different, but also of the families that touched their lives and a very biting social commentary on social climbers who choose money over worth. The Dashwood sisters come from money, but their dying father unwisely made no provisions for them and left all in the hands of their weak brother and his mercenary wife. Their brother means well but is in thrall to his wife Fanny who controls him and the purse strings, and the Dashwood women are given only a pittance to live on, and no addition to their dowries.

Of course, both the Ang Lee and more recent BBC movies let us know without question that their sister-in-law Fanny Ferrars Dashwood comes from a family whose rise in the world far outpaced their attempt at refinement, and seeing in the Dashwood sisters the example of what a real ""lady"" should be, she passionately despises them their effortless gentility. It is through her machinations that her husband's half sisters, younger sister and mother-in-law are reduced to living in a cold and distant cottage (""out of sight, out of mind"") on 500 L. a year (about $25,000 today), a far cry from the wealth and privilege in which they grew up and which gives them only a lower middle class status. When Fanny's brother Edward quietly admires Eleanor Dashwood, Mrs Dashwood unwisely hints at their mutual feelings and Fanny steps in to separate them.

The Ferrars family with the exception of Edward are alike in their love of money and position. Fearful of being mistaken for anything but the tonnish class they aspire to, they do anything to make sure that money and position are allied with the family and nothing less will do. With the Dashwood women banished far away, Fanny thinks that all is well. But fate takes a hand: not only in the form of the sporting Sir John Middleton and his loud but kindly mother-in-law Mrs Jennings but the chance invitation of the social-climbing cousins of Mrs Jennings, one of whom is aware of Edward's admiration of Eleanor Dashwood, and who puts a very large spoke in the wheel of Eleanor's possible happiness.

There are indeed people in this world who cannot bear to see anyone deserving to be happy, and thus it is for Fanny and Mrs Ferrars and the most enterprising Lucy Steele. Fanny, seeing Lucy as no threat and someone who is even lower down the pecking order of gentility, invites and befriends her over her own sisters-in-law with disastrous results. Seeing a social climber who is even more adept at manipulating people than herself, Fanny and her mother fall into unbecoming, and as Jane Austen subtly shows us, rather common hysterics.

It is Eleanor and the wonderfully noble and patient Colonel Brandon who are the real winners, people of true worth who are able to hide broken hearts yet still act with a nobility of spirit and who respectively get their hearts desires in the complementary Edward Ferrars and Marianne. These four people are vastly superior to almost everyone in this book, and are the most deserving of great happiness. For Edward and Eleanor, there are few regrets in the respective lack of fortune because they each see each other as their heart's desire (and things are eventually somewhat resolved financially for them to ease their situation). Marianne and the wonderful Colonel Brandon find true love with each other, mending each other's broken hearts, and as Jane Austen points out, Marianne never loves by halves and soon gives her heart completely to her Colonel, as he does to her.

It is worthwhile to note that Jane Austen did not shrink from discussing situations and social problems that were usually brushed under the carpet. The daughter of Colonel Brandon's first love is the victim of the unrepentant Willoughby who ruins her for sport and although he does care for Marianne, it is probably because Marianne has a family and especially a careful mother that makes him keep his distance. He is far too shallow to care much beyond his own pleasures and reading between the lines, we realise that Marianne's fate could have been much different if she had been less genteel.

This particular edition has some beautiful watercolour illustrations that can be enlarged on a Kindle Fire that are a lovely addition to the book. About version C. E. Brock- excellent digital copy, working pages and chapter links and no noticed typos or errors. Got it for 99 cents so excellent buy.

About the novel:
I've completed 3 Austen novels now bye order of my favorite stories through film and TV adaptations. Each has its charm but P&P is still my favorite and S&S now ranks third above Emma.

I find the dynamics of the sisters Elinor and Marianne most intriguing and endearing. Their mom and baby sister being more ornamental it's difficult to get a feel for them.

Perhaps I see some of my relationship with my siblings here but this novel really speaks to me. I can even relate to the brother and sister in law.

The sisters contrast more than Jane and Lizzy though we don't really get a Jane POV so it's not a fair comparison. Both have their own unique ways of navigating their world. Elinor all shy, reserved and carefully concealed emotion makes her stronger of the two especially in a society that doesn't reward passionate outbreaks. I felt bad for Marianne but also frustrated with her mom who failed to chaperone properly or even get her own head on straight and not encourage Willoughby without an idea of his intentions. A dad with some standards, and alive, would have stood some protection for these girls. Elinor is mislead too but I see that she did her best to remain detached and have no expectations though her hurt wasn't any less when ""that hussy"" (LOL Mrs. Jennings) stuck her claws into Elinor.

I wish I had read these books as a young teenager. Women haven't changed a whole lot (ans lying men too) and some of the double crossing and betrayals I suffered might have been avoided learning from these characters and Austen wisdom.

Her sarcasm is ever present as well. And overall it's an enjoyable read. It flowed better and faster than Emma which seemed to get hung up in places reminding me of Miss Bates rambling on and losing her point.

Willoughby is definitely a Scoundrel up there with Wickham. He is all about and only for himself and even as he tries to ""apologize"" to Elinor in one seen he never really does. He just had a minor twinge of conscience when he heard Marianne was possibly dying and had to insert himself into the drama of wronged star crossed lovers. He never meant to hurt her, but he never meant to marry her even though he gave her every expectation offering her expensive presents (horse Queen Mab) and showing her his would be future estate. No he is just like some guys today wowing the girl d'jour with his richest, having fun bathing in her admiration and his conquest of her (same as that unfortunate ward of Brandon's) and poof he's gone to hunt elsewhere.

People never change and Austen can teach us the way of the world and entertain as well. Excelente ejemplar de la obra. Pastas y hojas hermosamente decoradas. Fue el regalo perfecto para mi hija de 16 años a quien le interesó el idioma inglés de la época. Love ittt Jane Austin is a MUST read author, its a classic. Since the nature of the people did not change at all since 19th century, it a good textbook on human nature. Love it. 5+ stars (8/10 hearts). This was the last Austen book I read. The first time I read it, I wasn’t enthusiastic—probably because I was still reeling from shock by the end. But this time, I loved it. It’s… well, it’s silly to say it’s one of my favourites because I love them all, but I really do enjoy this one even more than some of the others. It’s so hard to rate the Austen books, but when I think about it I can set a pretty clear ranking based on how deeply I love the books. To me, Northanger Abbey is really only a hilarious satirical romp with a few good lessons, but Pride & Prejudice is a sparkling masterpiece of wit and style and character—an amazing story, an excellent piece of literature, and a splendid lesson. Emma is a sweet, light-hearted, yet thought-provoking journey, while Mansfield Park is a very deep, almost wistful & nostalgic bittersweet reflection. Persuasion is a delightful, satisfying romance… which I need to reread because I remember nothing more about it… and Sense & Sensibility strikes me a sort of mashup of Emma + Pride & Prejudice in style… more mature and serious than P&P, but with a more somber lesson than Emma.

Of course, the writing style was superb. Austen has a great gift for saying much while saying little, and is full of grace and dignity and beauty. Her trick of portraying character and setting in a few little strokes is pure genius, and her deep weave of plot and arc are absolutely amazing—and her witty humour! There’s just so much of it! Also, I say this every time, but Austen more than any other writer makes the people of past centuries live for me and reminds me most strikingly how we’re all human, and there’s nothing new under the sun… even slang!

The characters were similarly splendidly done. I find it so interesting how much I relate both to Marianne and to Elinor. I am not quite as silly and impolite as Marianne (I hope), but I certainly relate to her in many ways and was even more like her as a teen… And while as an oldest child I relate to Elinor a lot, I am not as steady and polite as Elinor (I wish). What a model she is, to be sure! She is such a wonderful woman—courageous, strong, beautiful, responsible, loving, and desirous of well-doing in all. Marianne was very sweet, and she meant well—but the older I get the more I understand how foolish her 17-year-old opinions are. Even if I still understand her POV very much. ;)

And then there's You-Know-Who. I love him, and then hate him, and then am fascinated into loving him again, and then despise him… I simply can’t figure him out and just puzzle over him and try to understand him for a long time after finishing the book. He made me think of Henry Crawford. Both were SO close to redemption but were too weak and threw it aside... and lost forever. (On that topic, though, he did make an important point: “I do not mean to justify myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge—that because she was injured she was irreproachable, and because I was a libertine, she must be a saint.” That is not something people consider enough—and not just about him.) He’s really a heartbreak… and like Elinor, I don’t know how to think of him.

As for Colonel Brandon, I loved him from start to finish. He’s simply amazing. I disliked Edward at first, but he won my regard and kept it to the end. What a respectable, honourable man he was! He messed up—he reminds me of Edmund Bertram—but he pulled through it all with good character. Lucy was horrid (though I always like her at first and am astonished by her nastiness); Robert was awful; Fanny and John were simply terrible; and Mrs. Ferrars (who is not a caricature!) is an ogress. Lady Middleton was... just… very irritating… yet she had her good points; and Sir John you couldn't help liking even as you shook your head or rolled your eyes at him. As for Mrs. Jennings, I learned to love her. She had so much real love and kindliness! Charlott Palmer was just… *shrugs*... and Mr. Palmer was mostly *eyeroll,* but ended up better than I expected; and I did like Mrs. Dashwood, even if she could be foolish and easily swayed. She was at least very loving and honestly admitted to her mistakes.

As for the storyline, it was hooking. I read this entire book in pretty much two days/sessions because I simply COULD NOT put it down. The plot was so done. What a rollercoaster! What laughter, what horror, what smiles! It’s sobering story, really, with some excellent lessons. I think what you come away with most is—how strong is your character? This is what will sink you or save you. Could I stand like Edward? Endure like Elinor? Persevere like Colonel Brandon? Am I judging people by appearances, or by their characters, or by their status, or by their influence? Do I passionately pursue your own loves and passionately grieve my own pain without noticing the hurt it can give others? Do I blindly pursue what is not for me, or happily choose to do what is not seemly because the one I love suggests it? This one whom I love—is he worthy of my love?

There’s so much to take away and to come back for.

Content: A woman related to one of the MCs is married to a man she despises and runs away from home with another man. Being abandoned by him, she births his child and becomes a prostitute. Her daughter (16) is seduced by another young man, impregnated, and abandoned. Barely detailed + tastefully handled, but probably for ages 16/18+ depending on situation.

A Favourite Quote: “Four months!”—cried Marianne again.—“So calm! so cheerful! how have you been supported?”—
“By feeling that I was doing my duty.— ... I did not love only him;—and while the comfort of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt. Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion. I would not have you suffer on my account.”
A Favourite Beautiful Quote: “They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations. “Is there a felicity in the world,” said Marianne, “superior to this?—Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours.” Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer.”
A Favourite Humorous Quote: “Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. For many years of her life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and now, by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again. In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his present engagement.” Sense and Sensibility is a lot like a Fast & Furious movie, except there are no supercar races, gun fights, fist fights, robbery, and scantily clad girls. Come to think of it Sense and Sensibility is nothing like a Fast & Furious movie. I just had no idea how to start off the review.

Actually Sense and Sensibility is (seriously now) a lot like Pride and Prejudice. What with the sisters, one stoic and worldly, one a little wild, impulsive and naive, not to mention the youngest one who is the Maggie Simpson* of the family and does not have much to do. Then we have the nice but immediately friendzoned gentlemen, the handsome cad and the twittering mom with the dollar GBP sign popping up in her eyes when considering her daughters’ matrimonial prospects.

In all fairness to Ms. Austen, the two books are not that similar, Sense and Sensibility is her debut novel and she later used some of the same elements to write her magnum opus (“Pride” that is). The book is entirely focussed on the two Dashwood sisters Elinor and Marianne and their felicitous relationships with men. This is not the kind of book you should put through the Bechdel test because the ladies herein very seldom talk about anything else except the men in their lives. Still, you never have to wonder what the ladies in this book do in their spare time because all their time seems to be spare time, Thomas Hardy’s heroines seem to have much harder and more productive lives. Still, I don’t want to put too much of a negative spin on Sense and Sensibility because it is a pleasure to read in spite of its flaws and low stakes.

Jane Austen is brilliant at writing silly, twittering, meddling women who actually mean well but never stop talking except when they are listening through the door and completely misunderstanding the snatches of conversation they could hear. Mrs. Jennings, a friend of the family, is my favorite character in the book, she can always be relied upon to hilariously bark up the wrong tree. Curiously characterization is both a strength and a weakness of this book. The “good guys”, namely Edward Ferrars and Colonel Brandon, are awfully dull, semi-zombified gentlemen. Whereas Willoughby the cad is lively and always game for a laugh. Sir John Dashwood, who is somewhat of an antagonist, is not so lively but he is hilariously tactless and shallow. Our two heroines are both too nice and are no match for the almost-femme fatale Lucy Steele.

Jane Austen is at her best when she is skewering people in polite society and terribly inhibited gents:
“The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away”

Unexhilarating! LOL! Then there is this bit which is worthy of a high five:

“she did not really like them at all. Because they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical; but THAT did not signify. It was censure in common use, and easily given.”

I started reading Jane Austen to find out what the fuss is about, why do the studios keep adapting her works for films and TV? Initially I did not get it, her storylines always seem inconsequential to me but I have always liked her beautiful prose so I keep coming back to read more. With Sense and Sensibility it finally clicked for me. The snark! Beneath the Victorian politeness and sense of decorium Ms. Austen was a fabulously snarky lady. Having come to this conclusion I am practically ready to join the rank of the Janeites. I already have a bonnet, with several bees in it.

* and her name is Maggie Dashwood! (sort of)"
Emma (AmazonClassics Edition),"Charming, rich, and clever, heiress Emma Woodhouse has no need for an occupation—or a husband. Still, she considers herself quite skilled at matchmaking. Although her dear friend Mr. Knightley advises against it, there is nothing that she enjoys more than entangling herself in the romantic lives of others. But when one of her well-intentioned plans goes awry—as Mr. Knightley rightly predicted—Emma must face the consequences of her meddling.
The delightfully imperfect Emma and her Mr. Knightley have captured the hearts of generations of readers. A lively comedy of manners that has been adapted several times for the screen, Emma is the last work Jane Austen lived to see published.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Emma, this edition of Emma (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I'm reading Emma again for the third time. It happened like this: I thought I'd try an audio book on CD for the first time, something to listen to in the car besides music. Scanning the shelves at the local bookstore, I saw loads of contemporary best sellers, self and financial help, new age and evangelical Christian spirituality, and Jane Austen's Emma in MP3 format, all on one disc. Austen! Water in the desert! I scooped her up.

For the last week I've been listening to her in my car. At the beginning it was without much concentration. Over the next few days my attention gradually increased. Now I'm hooked. Down the throat. Through the gut. Again. It happens to me every time I return to Jane. I just can't get enough. The last two nights I've gone to bed reading ahead of where I've listened. Even though the story is coming back to me, I'm still taken by it, hook line & sinker. Jane's reeling me in, and the line is utterly slack.

Now, I am a guy. I break out in hives if I happen to accidentally brush a romance novel. As far as I am concerned, bodice rippers where the tall olive skinned duke inevitably has his forceful yet gentle way with the heroine are good only as ammunition with which to tease the women in my life who enjoy such tripe. Having said this, I realize a lot of people also refer to Jane Austen as ""Chick Lit,"" equating her with the likes of Nicolas Sparks. For the record, those people are on crack.

Austen is much more a comedic writer than a writer of what we call romances. She is simply a hoot. Subtle disjunctures and ironies build to exquisite crescendos. She has me laughing every other page. Her characters, even her unpleasant and ridiculous ones, tend to breed sympathy. Like most of my favorite books, she creates worlds, or a world, really (all of her books are set in the same historic and geographic milieu,) which comforts and gladdens. The feeling I get from her is much like the feeling I get when I read Tolkien describe the Shire or Last Homely House, or something like the children's book Frog & Toad to my niece.

It's an eating poached egg on toast snuggled up inside under a quilt on the couch with a cup of tea on a rainy day kind of feeling. (Don't you just love English prepositions and phrasal verbs? Try doing that in French! Austen and phrasal verbs: two of the many reasons English speakers ought to rejoice in their language, I say!)

Anyway, during all of her stories, including Emma, Europe was being blown apart by the Napoleonic Wars, and the only oblique references in any of her stories to that maelstrom is that Great Britain has a mobilized Army (Pride & Prejudice) and an active Navy (Persuasion.) The reason the military is important has nothing to do with Austerlitz, Waterloo, Trafalgar or any of that nonsense. Rather, it is that both services have officers which make very suitable suitors for women of her heroines' social positions (Lt. Wickham & Capt. Wentworth, for example.)

Some brand this awful: elitist, sexist, parochial. I, for one, find it beautiful. Small, intimate, ordered, secure, anchored. Very human and sane, that is.

What matters most is not what some silly diminutive one armed Corsican with maniacal delusions of world conquest is doing; no. What really matters is whether and how Mr. Woodhouse takes his gruel, or if Mr. Elton will propose to Harriet. Or if Mr. Knightly and Mrs. Weston have come to visit yet, today. Will Mr. Frank Churchill come, and what is he like? Has Emma truly foiled Mr. Martin's advances on her friend, he being an entirely unsuitable yeoman farmer? Harriet must marry a gentleman, you see.

Just so. Indeed, these are truly the things that mattered- and still matter- most. Don't let the history books and the reverse snobbery of some critics fool you.

Instead go read this book, and every other that Jane wrote, and prepare to be enchanted. I have always loved ""Sense and Sensibility"" and wanted to expand into more of Austen's works. This one did not disappoint! It is a fantastic tale with all the usual Austen humor and wittiness that work so well in her stories! In fact, it is now up there with ""Sense"" as my favorite Austen work!

""Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.""

The first sentence in the novel really sets the stage for all the mistakes the main character makes throughout! This novel tells the story of Emma Woodhouse, a privileged young lady who, with nothing else to occupy her time, loves matchmaking among her friends. She loves it so much that she doesn't pay any attention to her true love right under her nose! Of course things don't go the way Emma would like and there are the usual misunderstandings but things work out in the end and everyone ends up with who they are destined to be with.

This had been called one of Austen's best works and I can agree with that. I really loved this story. This certainly is the ""lightest"" of Austen's novels as you will not find any lives ruined or huge scandals that ruin reputations. It is simply (and wonderfully so) the story of a small, English village where the inhabitants really have nothing substantial to occupy their time; none more so than Emma. I think one of the things Austen is so marvelous at is her ability to really focus on her characters and their everyday lives and none of her novels do this as well as Emma. As there is no serious ""action"" the story must therefore focus on everyday occurrences. You could call this a comedy of manners as the characters revolve within a very strict code of behavior and etiquette where everything should move along very smoothly but of course, because of meddling (mainly Emma's) things always go completely wrong! The novel is full of the usual, heavy Austen dialogue and description which I'm sure can get tedious for some readers (I did find myself skimming over some of Miss. Bates' extended ramblings) but, as in her other novels, it does not get in the way and can really help the reader come to terms with a time very foreign from our own. Many modern readers find the ""elitist"" attitudes in Austen's books a turn off and condemn the novels. However, Austen is not intending to make these attitudes seem wonderful; if some readers would look closer they would realize that she is really satirizing these attitudes and showing them for the silliness they really were. The main character, Emma, can be a bit annoying at times, but she is so open about her own faults and weaknesses that its hard to dislike her. In fact, you do see her acknowledging in several places her mistakes and is able to laugh them off and learn from them. Austen herself said that Emma was a character that nobody would really like but herself; I disagree.Yes, she can come across as snobbish, arrogant, and overly conscious of her place in society but what can you expect from a girl who has been raised by a doting father and governess? Mixed with those slightly irritating qualities, though, is a sweetness and a true desire to be helpful which really makes her endearing. I highly doubt Emma's personality is that much different from other young ladies of the time. I think the true shining star in this novel, though, is Mr. Knightley, Emma's close friend and true English gentleman (supposedly this was Austen's favorite hero as well and created her ideal gentleman in him; his name is no accident). He is kind and thoughtful, witty and intelligent, but blunt and always ready to bring Emma back down to Earth. Their bantering back and forth is really charming. I only wish we knew more about Mr. Knightley's background and that we could see more of him in the novel! The rest of the characters in the novel are all brilliantly drawn and even though they are not the focus of the story, you come to know them as well as the two mains: the eccentric and hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, sweet and naive Harriet Smith, the kind Westons, slightly foppish Frank Churchill and the very reserved Jane Fairfax, the kindly Miss. and Mrs. Bates, and the exceedingly arrogant Eltons.

This is a wonderful and delightful story and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a light and charming story about a slightly flawed but kind young lady (and who among us is not flawed?) who, through a series of blunders, grows and matures. It is also a humorous story poking fun at the strict code of behavior and the social classes of the day. This is not a review about the book, but about the quality of the product. It’s like newspaper quality (smells like it too) with a cover that looks like it was printed at home on paper you can commonly find at a stationery store. Might have to throw it out after finishing it because it’s so flimsy. Not for keeps. É meu livro favorito, introspectivo, mostra o crescer e amadurecer da personagem, perfeito! Nice edition. Includes also a glossary My copy was excellent for this book. Even after multiple rereads I am yet to see even slight damage. Go for it if you wish to read.

Now as for the book...I don't think any amount of words would be enough to describe Austen's brilliance. For people new to classics, I do think that Emma could be a difficult book to start with cause of the slow pace of the story (but it's all worth it in the end cause the pace develops characters and scenes for the plot twists in the end). I personally loved the entire Jane Fairfax story and words aren't enough to describe my love for Emma and Mr. Knightley. ""If I loved you less I might be able to talk about it more"" one of the most beautiful lines to be ever written. J’aime trop je livre , vraiment à posséder une copie :)"
Jane Eyre (AmazonClassics Edition),"The orphaned Jane Eyre has emerged a fiercely independent young woman. As governess at Thornfield Hall, she’s found her first real home—though it stands in the shadow of the estate’s master, Mr. Rochester, and its haunted halls ring with maniacal laughter. For even the grandest houses have secrets.
As much a story about defying convention as it is about coming-of-age, Jane Eyre remains one of the most beloved novels in the English language. Both Gothic and Victorian in its influence and scope, it captures one woman’s determination to live life on her own terms—choosing courage over fear, while finding power in love and compassion.
Revised edition: Previously published as Jane Eyre, this edition of Jane Eyre (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre is a timeless literary masterpiece, blending romance, gothic mystery, and a deeply personal journey of self-discovery. This Vintage Classics edition presents the novel beautifully, with high-quality printing, a striking cover design, and a well-structured layout that enhances readability.

The novel itself follows Jane, an orphaned young woman who grows into a fiercely independent and morally strong character. Her relationship with the brooding Mr. Rochester is both passionate and complex, set against the eerie backdrop of Thornfield Hall. Brontë’s writing is vivid and emotional, tackling themes of love, class, gender, and self-respect.

This edition may also include insightful introductions or notes, depending on the version, making it a great choice for both first-time readers and longtime fans.

Pros:
✔ A compelling, richly detailed classic
✔ Strong, independent female protagonist
✔ Beautiful Vintage Classics design and print quality
✔ Engaging mix of romance, gothic mystery, and social commentary

Cons:
✖ The prose can feel dense for modern readers
✖ Some plot developments may feel melodramatic to contemporary tastes

Jane Eyre remains a must-read, and the Vintage Classics edition does justice to this beloved novel. If you appreciate classic literature with a strong heroine and deep emotional depth, this book deserves a place on your shelf. After several weeks I have just finished the 1847 novel JANE EYRE by Charlotte Bronte.
Loosely based on the Cinderella fairytale, popular at the time, it provides a heady offering of soaring language, complex characters, epic adventure, and an intimate entry into a world very far from our own, yet one from which we come.
Yes, it has dated some, but a generous reader will put that aside for the novel's abundant riches of elevated thought, challenging syntax, operatic structure, and wry humor.
Very interestingly, too, Wikipedia tells us, ""The novel revolutionized prose fiction, being the first to focus on the moral and spiritual development of its protagonist through an intimate first-person narrative, where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity. Charlotte Brontë has been called the 'first historian of the private consciousness' and the literary ancestor of writers such as Marcel Proust and James Joyce.'""
The novel was ahead of its time in other ways too. Jane's fiercely independent character frames the whole and allows the novel to approach with freshness and dignity the universal topics of class, sexuality, religion, wealth disparity, self-control, restraint, and feminism.
JANE EYRE is widely considered one of the greatest novels in the English language. I am very happy I read it. You will be too. -- CHUCK BAUER, 2025
""I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do. I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.""
—Charlotte Brontë, Jane Eyre The story Jane Eyre is a classic romance novel. This story was written in in 1847 by Charlotte Bronte. As you can image the story is very influenced by the social norms of that time. But in essence that is what make the story so believable. Jane Eyre is about a young girl who was orphaned and made to stay with her cruel rich aunt. In Jane's younger years she gets verbally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins. One day Jane fights back and is eventually sent to a boarding school for girls. The life style at the school is harsh and dangerous. The girls living their have very little clothing, food, shelter, and people willing to take care of them. Because of these bad circumstances illness strikes. After that occasion the climate in the school changes to one where the girls are provided for. Jane is able to get a wonderful education, and when she graduates she decides to become a governess. She puts an add out in the paper and is contacted by Mrs. Fairfax to become the governess to Adele Varnes. Jane goes to live at Thornfield Manner. She spends many happy months there. Until Mr. Rochester comes to visit. He is Jane's employer and the guardian of Adele. Mr. Rochester confuses Jane in ways that no one every has. Love sparks between the two of them. But this love is tested by secrets from Mr. Rochesters past!
I found all of the characters in this story to be believable and realistic. They seemed like people you would meet on the street. Well, minus the fact that they have the mannerism of someone from the 1800s. In particular I love Jane Eyre. She is a strong woman. That any female could relate to. It surprised me when I first read the book that she was so strong, since this book was both written in the 1800s and took place there. Also, the emotions that Jane has are very realistic. While she was at the girls boarding school she lost a friend and it felt really real when it happened. I will admit to shedding a few tears when it happened. I think that the bases for a good book is if the story can touch the reader and for me this book did.
I did really like the story. The plot and characters where both interesting and well thought out. At times the book was very slow and my interest was lost. It could get a little boring if you don't have a lot of patience and determination. My favorite part of the book was the ending. The ending was happy and a good solution to both Jane and Mr. Rochester's problems. It left me satisfied and I didn't have anymore questions. My least part of the book was the middle. There wasn't enough change in the story and Jane was too caught up in her own head. There needed to be more action there or even a new character. The middle just didn't do it for me.
I would recommend this story to someone else. Probably an adult or a teenager. Like I said before you need a lot of patience and determination to get through the book. So, for anyone under the age of 15 it would be a very difficult read. To really enjoy this book you have to love history and a good romance. To really get this book you have to understand the motivations of people in the mid 1800s. It really wouldn't make to much sense to someone who doesn't have a grasp on history. I would give this book 4.5. The plot and characters in this story are amazing. However the plot sometimes is somewhat slow. Overall I believe that Charlotte Bronte did a wonderful job writing this book. O hype em cima deste livro é merecido. Tanto que, ao terminar, fiquei me perguntando como eu já não o havia lido. Pode ser impressão minha, mas nunca ouvi muito sobre ele no Brasil. Em países de língua inglesa é um clássico e preferido de muitos. Por isso resolvi conhecê-lo, e da melhor forma possível, nesta edição em capa dura da Everyman's Library (que em minha opinião só perde para a Folio Society em qualidade e acabamento dos livros, sendo muito mais em conta. Por exemplo, eles têm a lombada costurada, coisa muuuito rara atualmente. O papel é de excelente qualidade e a capa tem acabamento de tecido muito agradável ao toque - só compro clássicos desta editora agora). Sobre Jane Eyre: Jane é uma personagem muito marcante e profunda. É uma verdadeira heroína em todos os sentidos. A história é complexa, sendo narrada em primeira pessoa (uma inovação à época) em diferentes etapas da vida de Jane. A primeira parte é extremamente tocante e envolvente. A segunda surpreende muito. O romance é épico e até bem ousado considerando o contexto. Recomendo FORTEMENTE a todos. cadeau d'anniversaire parfait.
merci الطابعة كويسة جودتها متوسطة لكن المبلغ كتير عليه و الكتاب جالي الغلاف بتاعه متني شوية من تحت Trama:
Dopo un'infanzia difficile, di povertà e di privazioni, la giovane Jane trova la via del riscatto: si procura un lavoro come istruttrice presso la casa di un ricco gentiluomo, il signor Rochester. I due iniziano a conoscersi, si parlano, si confrontano e imparano a rispettarsi. Dal rispetto nasce l'amore e la possibilità per Jane di una vita serena. ma proprio quando un futuro meraviglioso appare vicino, viene alla luce una terribile verità, quasi a dimostrare che Jane non può essere felice, non può avere l'amore, non può sfuggire al suo destino. Rochester sembra celare un tremendo segreto: una presenza minacciosa si aggira infatti nelle soffitte del suo tetro palazzo.

E’ un libro piacevole, che si legge tutto d’un fiato. La storia è avvincente, ma non è una favola, potrebbe essere benissimo una storia vera, poichè non termina con un finale scontato o completamente felice.
E’ un libro che ricalca perfettamente la vita dell’epoca, immortalandola in un ritratto eterno.

Citazione:
“In genere si suppone che le donne siano molto calme; ma le donne hanno gli stessi sentimenti degli uomini: hanno bisogno di esercitare le loro facoltà e di una palestra per i loro sforzi, al pari dei loro fratelli; soffrono per una costrizione troppo rigida, per un troppo completo ristagno esattamente come soffrirebbero gli uomini; ed è segno di ristrettezza mentale sostenere che queste creature privilegiate dovrebbero limitarsi a infornar sformati, far la calza, suonare il piano e ricamar borsette. E’ stupido condannarle e prendersi gioco di loro se cercano di fare e di imparare più di quanto il costume abbia stabilito necessario per il loro sesso.” Es una libro muy pequeño, casi del tamaño de mi mano, la he comparado con otra edición de Jane Eyre y esta es mucho más hermosa pero pequeña. El libro es de pasta dura, los bordes de las hojas son dorados, trae su propio separador, y al quitarle la cubre portada es aún más bonito, se siente como si la portada fuera de tela. La letra está bien para el tamaño del libro, me llego en una caja guante protegido con bolsas de aire, sin embargo no llego cubierto de ningún plástico por lo que la cubre portada llego un poco maltratada. Jane Eyre es mi libro favorito, se lo recomiendo a cualquiera que desee leerlo."
The Lost World (AmazonClassics Edition),"There’s only one way for Professor George Edward Challenger to prove that dinosaurs still roam the earth. He invites skeptical journalist Edward Malone to accompany him and a group of adventurers to see the creatures with his own eyes. But when they arrive at the fantastic volcanic plateau in the Amazon where time stands still, their expedition quickly becomes one of survival.
With its cliff-hanging escapes, rousing humor, and nailbiting suspense, The Lost World is a pioneering work of fantasy-adventure that paved the way for every thrill ride to follow.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Lost World, this edition of The Lost World (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I know Doyle for being the author of Sherlock Holmes but not until I read this did I realize he also wrote fantasy science fiction ahead of his time. Though some verbiage used can be offensive nowadays, it’s truly and thoroughly enjoyable novel An adventure so extraordinary that it will be mistaken in one month for a dream and, in some years, for a myth. In South America, our old maps had the figure of a dinosaur to mark terras incognitas, unexplored lands (not anymore as by now all has been already explored). I think it's because The lost World entered our consciousness; dreams and memories liquefy, until feeling them as a shadow of truth, fiction whose stuff could had been originated from rumors and ancient stories.

You need to be a kid to fully enjoy this book. As an adult you will find the characters are (cherishable) caricatures, in a small isolated region I suspect the creatures, contrary to what happens in the book, would evolve to be small in size; the scientists drive a species into the brink of utter extinction :S, they seem to not care that much about the dinosaurs as we don't get to see much and is like Conan Doyle got bored with them so he introduced new characters that actually make the plot mundane. In the positive side natives are treated as adults, with differences, some good and some evil. As a native myself is sad each time all are presented as noble and wise people, an inhumane unidimensionality in my opinion, also the narrated landscape is majestic. And lastly in the side of curiosities professor Challenger is accused to forge photographs to sell an impossible discovery (it's at the beginning so it's not a spoiler), I read that Arthur Conan Doyle believed in fairies because a photo of two girls with dancing fairies in a meadow; afterwards it was known that the photo was staged with pieces of paper, a forged photo... I don't see myself re-reading ""The Lost World“ but I am truly happy to have read it, and I am sure you will be happy too : )

About the AmazonClassics Edition it has no illustrations, which I understand were present in its first publication, if it matters it depends of personal tastes, usually drawings don't express what one can imagine so I am fine with their absence. Beyond that this is an excellent edition with X-Ray and a modern and clean formatting, pure text without nosy introductions to spoil the adventure. Highly recommended edition. Crazy adventure tale that wraps you in intrigue and colors your world! This one really got me-so exciting and unguessable! The characters in this book were sooooo great! I absolutely loved it!! And the adventures and the way it was written so so so much fun!! Loved it! There was a time when I read mostly classics. As I grew older my tastes changed, so now I am more attracted to modern speculative fiction and romance novels.
But it’s never to late to resurrect good, old habits. And what is the better book for that then the predecessor of Jurassic Park?

LIKES

* Written in a form of a journal and a series of letters, The Lost World adds a personal touch to the story. A lot of time I felt like the narrator, journalist Ed Malone, is talking to me.

* Professor Challenger was over-confident, sometimes rude in his directness and very stubborn. If I have met professor Challenger in real life, I would have labeled him as a jerk and tried to ignore him. But I like these kind of characters in novels, they keep the story interesting.

We traveled entirely by compass, and once or twice there were differences of opinion between Challenger and the two Indians, when, to quote the Professor’s indignant words, the whole party agreed to “trust the fallacious instincts of undeveloped savages rather than the highest product of modern European culture.”

* Dinosaurs! They are like dragons, but they actually existed. I don’t know why am I attracted to the stories about these cold-blooded, savage, lizardly creatures, but I am fascinated by their habits and by the facts that something so majestic existed on our planet.

* Beautiful descriptions of nature and wildlife.

DISLIKES

* Illustrations are missing. Original paperback (and hopefully other editions) had a lot of drawings that accompanied the story. Sadly, this free ebook version has none. I love it when journal type books have illustrations, so I was very disappointed they were not included.

* Unrushed pace. I must (shamefully) admit I am spoiled by modern books and a lot of times I wanted the narration to go way faster than it did.

* Slow start. I read a lot, but there were not many books with bigger intros than The Lost World. The whole first half of The Lost World is made of descriptions of Malone’s life, how he met professor Challenger and reasons for the expedition. By the time real adventure started, I almost lost interest to continue reading.

* I expected dinosaurs will be more featured in the story. Don’t get me wrong, they have a big role, but real dinosaurs are actually present in only small portion of the novel.

* Big announcements that most of the time didn’t deliver. Again, I’m probably spoiled by modern fiction, so I expected something even more shocking when Malone (more thean once) announced: “the most dreadful experience”.

* News writing style. Since the narrator is a journalist, the whole story is told in specific style and tone with big announcements and phrases that build tension. This form of writing works for smaller news articles, but I found it too taxing when applied to the whole novel.

* Stupid decisions (like in a bad horror movie). How will I prove myself to these experienced adventurers? Oh, I know! I’ll go and explore this unknown land full of dangerous animals and savages by myself. I’ll go at night so no one will see me! And I’m not coming back until I have something spectacular to tell. (This is actual decision by Malone, I just paraphrased his line of thought a little.)

* Story has lost it’s WOW effect. Most of the classics suffer from this illness. Even if you haven’t read them, you have heard about them before, so you know what is going to happen most of the time.

IN THE END…

The Lost World was too slow for my taste, but when I think that it was written more than 100 years ago, I must admit it’s pretty well done. If you want to know how the dinosaurs madness started, this is a classic you should not miss. Just make sure that your book has illustrations included. It is certain from a different century of writing. Sir Arthur Doyle wrote as a man of his times, and this work certainly shows it. Lots of sexist language and ideas but a fun read still. Not as good as his Sherlock Holmes works but still fun. Der berühmte Zoologe Prof. Challenger wird von der Fachgemeinde nicht mehr Ernst genommen. Er behauptet prähistorische lebende Tiere auf einer Südamerika-Expedition entdeckt zu haben. Dort hat er ein Skizzenbuch von einem Mann gefunden, welcher einen Stegosaurus in seinem Tagebuch gezeichnet hat. Er ist seiner Spur auf die Plateaus gefolgt und konnte dort auch eine Fotografie von einem Pterodactylus machen. Doch keiner seiner Kollegen schenkt ihm Glauben.

Prof. Challenger: „When great facts are laid before you, you have not the intuition, the imagination which would help you to understand them. You can only throw mud at the men who have risked their lives to open new fields of science.”

Um das alles also vor seinen Kollegen zu beweisen, plant er eine Expedition bei dem ihm sein erbitterter Gegner Prof. Summerlee, der expeditionserfahrene Jäger Lord John Roxton und der Journalist Mr. Malone begleiten werden.
Als sie auf schwierigen Wegen endlich das Plateau erreichen, sind sie auf das, was sie antreffen, überhaupt nicht vorbereitet. Es scheint zudem auch keinen Weg mehr zurück zu geben.

Lord John Roxton: „…they are – Missin’ Links, and I wish they had stayed missin’.”

Arthur Conan Doyle hat einen großartigen Roman geschaffen, der voller Spannung und Humor steckt. Aber auch die Wissenschaft kommt hier nicht zu kurz. Dieser Roman ist für die damalige Zeit (1912) auf dem aktuellsten Stand der Wissenschaft, aber natürlich ist es legitim, wenn der Autor auch etwas seine Fantasie spielen lässt.
“The Lost World” ist ein wirklich spannender Abenteuer-Klassiker, den man unbedingt einmal gelesen haben sollte. I have never been a Sherlock Holmes fan but I was told this was a good book.
I enjoyed it but I do find that Arthur Conan Doyle very long winded. Really nice book. If your someone who likes fiction you should definitely read this. Great purchase! This is a classic. This is, without doubt, one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. It just unfolds in front of you, the imagery and detail is fantastic. It doesn't try to shock or need to be incredibly complex. Fantastic"
North and South (AmazonClassics Edition),"When a crisis of faith prompts his departure from the Church of England, Margaret Hale’s father moves his family north to bleak, industrial Milton. At first, Margaret is put off by the town’s grit and poverty—a stark contrast to her rural southern hometown. But when she is awakened to the suffering of Milton’s hardworking citizens, she makes it her mission to improve their lives. However, Margaret soon finds herself at odds with the man she is falling in love with—the handsome, bullheaded industrialist John Thornton.
Skillfully told, North and South is not only an illuminating novel of its era but an enchanting love story that is sure to linger in the hearts of readers long after the last page.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as North and South, this edition of North and South (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I read this book after watching the mini-tv series with Richard Armitage. I loved the series and was blown away at his performance as a romantic character (as opposed to the characters Thorin and Guy of Gisbourne). I found the main plot of the book to be similar to Pride and Prejudice, but it also covered characters from the working class and provides insight on how the Industrial Revolution changed relationships between masters and workers. The book was written just after the Industrial Revolution, and though the story-line is fictional, Gaskell's knowledge of industrial towns and of the working class were real. She goes into detail about the sociology behind the interdependent relationship of workers and masters by using Mr Thornton (master), Nicholas Higgins (worker) and Margaret Hale (the outsider) as conduits to discuss the philosophical essays of John Locke and Henry Stuart Mill. The social status of the characters is also interesting with Mr. Thornton as part of the nouveau rich, Higgins part of the working class and Margaret as part the upper class (by blood if not by money). I imagine if Gaskell had been born in our time, she would have been a successful anthropologist or sociologist.

The romantic stuff made me giggle like a little girl and I was always looking forward to the next encounter between Margaret and Mr. Thornton. I wish there could have been a chapter which took place a couple years after the end of the book to show how the characters are getting on. It ended too soon!

The book is a 19th century romantic classic and it reads like one too. If you're unfamiliar with that style of writing, the Industrial Revolution or the famous philosophers who contributed to discussion on the working class, you might want to touch up on some history a bit before reading this. You only need the basics, but it really helps to understand the context. It's well worth it though, and I think this had become one of my favorite books! ""North and South"" is a well written novel by iconic Victorian author Elizabeth Gaskell. It is her third novel. It is of medium length, and, allowing for the fact that Victorian Literature is not the same as modern conversational American English, is mostly highly readable. I liked the novel very much.

I have only read one other major novel by Elizabeth Gaskell prior to this one. It is her first novel, ""Mary Barton"". I liked this novel much more. Both of these novels are stories about different social and economic classes in Victorian England. Both novels include episodes of economic strife and extreme hardship among the urban poor. Both involve the examples of the rich being indifferent at times and virtuous at other times.

I was ambivalent about ""Mary Barton"". There were times that I felt it was preachy and unrealistic. Sort of Charles Dickens without the wry humor and dimension of entertainment. Having now read this novel I am concerned that I was unfair in my assessment of ""Mary Barton"". This novel, ""North and South"" seems to have more wry humor and also a gentle romantic dimension that was pleasant and interesting to contemplate, while at the same time addressing very dreadful issues of poverty and hunger among the urban poor.

I did not like it as much as many Charles Dickens novels but that is a fairly high bar for me. Of the Charles Dickens novels that I have read, this novel reminds me most of ""Hard Times"". I actually liked this novel better than ""Hard Times"" but I have liked every other novel by Charles Dickens that I have ever read better than this one.

As for George Eliot, my favorite author, while Victorian, she stands alone in my personal literary universe. I find her work so nuanced, intellectually sophisticated, and multifaceted that I cannot easily compare her works to other authors, Victorian or otherwise. I suppose this novel most reminds of ""Felix Holt The Radical"". But to me the novels are at two different levels, as if one is comparing Christopher Marlowe to Shakespeare.

If one is a Jane Austen fan, in the event that it matters, I have read every work that has been published authored by Jane Austen, including incomplete works published after her death. I still prefer Jane Austen to Elizabeth Gaskell. Jane Austen is, of course, pre Victorian. While humorous and romantic, Jane Austen's work does not focus on the extreme poverty of Industrial Age England.

In summary, I am very glad to have had the opportunity to read ""North and South"". My opinion is that this novel has more warmth, gentle humor, and a romantic aspect that ""Mary Barton"" did not have. I am anxious that I am now being unfair in my recollections of ""Mary Barton"". It does all of this while still addressing the same important social and economic issues of the author's first novel. After a short respite from this author I believe I will next read ""Cranford"". Thank You... I was captivated by this story from the start to the end. I am sure that my northern English heritage helped, as I recognised the local dialect and sayings, and the attitude to life, but the book also educated me on the origins of those things. So it gave me new insights into my heritage, but also into human nature in general, as the best books always do. This book also goes further into human nature than modern writing, by going deep into the individual's soul and their contemplation of their moral code, sin, guilt, responsibility to lift and love all mankind, and their need to improve, to grow, and to do better. I found that human depth delightfully refreshing. All of Elizabeth Gaskell's novels do this, and she writes with compassion for all her characters, including the morally weak.

Once you adapt to the slower, more thoughtful pace of the writing that reflects the book's place in time, it reads like the author is talking to you alone about her personal experiences in the north and the differences between the industrial north and the agricultural/citified south. The characters were much more realistic than the film, which had the main characters do things that Elizabeth Gaskell would never have considered, like having an honourable man kick in a defenceless man in a fit of uncontrolled temper, or a couple kissing mouths on a train station in public. These things jar in the film version, as in a lot of modern film adaptations, that override the historicity of the original in a bid to appeal to modern tastes. Whereas everything in the book is still natural, internally consistent, and true to the times.

I have a preference for more tidy endings, where the loose ends aren't left, and this one was happy enough, but pretty abrupt, not explaining how the couple moved forward through the difficulties they face at the end. That would have been another education in human relations and I'm sad the opportunity was missed to pursue the issues. But still, 5 stars. Wie soviele andere bin auch ich durch die BBC-Verfilmung auf das Buch aufmerksam geworden. Aufgrund der sehr 'englischen' Geschichte habe ich mich daran gewagt, es auf Englisch zu lesen (und habe erst später völlig verblüfft gelesen, dass es gar keine deutsche Übersetzung gibt, was bei einem Buch dieser Qualität unverständlich ist).

Das Buch dreht sich um die Figur der Margarete Hale, die Tochter eines englischen Pfarrers um 1850. Der Vater beendet aus inneren Konflikten heraus seinen Pfarrersdienst und die Familie (Vater, Mutter, Margarete) ziehen aus dem idyllischen, ländlichen Helstone im Süden Englands in das nördliche, industriell geprägte Milton. Dort begegnen sie der Welt der Baumwollspinnereien, der Fabrikante, der Händler, der Arbeiter, einer eher grauen, steinernen, stinkenden Umwelt, die im Gegensatz zu ihrem grünen, farbenfrohen, ländlichen Idyll Südenglands steht. Margaret begegnet im speziellen dem Fabrikanten Mr. Thornton, der eine der Baumwollfabriken führt und zusammen mit seiner bestimmenden Mutter lebt, zu der er eine innige Beziehung hat.

Margarete verkörpert den Typ der Frau um 1850, die in ihrer grundlegenden Haltung der Tradition verpflichtet ist (in Moral und Anstand, Denken in geschellschaftlichen Schichten und Pflichtgefühl gegenüber der Familie), in vielen Denk- und Verhaltensweisen aber die aufkommende Moderne aufnimmt (in Sensibilität für die Ungerechtigkeit gegenüber armen sozialen Schichten, in Freiheit des Denkens, in teilweise selbstbewussten Auftreten gegenüber Männern). Thornton ist der Fabrikant, der zwar die Rolle des Fabrikanten als 'Master' über seine Arbeiter konsequent vertritt, dabei aber mehr als andere auch Verantwortung und Pflicht gegenüber seinen Arbeitern empfindet.

Das Buch erzählt nun im Sinne eines Entwicklungsromans Geschichten rund um Familie von Margarete (Krankheit und Tod der Eltern, die Geschichte um einen Bruder, der wegen Teilnahme an einer Meuterei als Offizier aus England verbannt ist) und um die sozialen Zustände in Milton (v.a. exemplarisch am Kontakt Margaretes zu einer Arbeiterfamilie und einem stattfindenden Streik). Darin hineingewebt ist die Geschichte um die Beziehung von Margarete mit Thornton. Sie beginnt mit verbalen Streitgesprächen, wird dann emotionaler, um nach einem krisenhaften Auseinanderbrechen, sich dann wieder emotional aufzuladen. Diese Liebesgeschichte erinnert nun an Jane Austens Paare. Sie ist aber definitiv nur ein Teil des Ganzen. Weite Teile erinnern in ihrer Betonung sozialer Misstände eher an Dickens oder in ihrer Verquickung von Familiengeschichte mit Schilderung gesellschaftlicher Entwicklungen an den frühen Thomas Mann. Das Buch ist eine ausgewogene Mischung aus Liebe-, Familien- und Gesellschaftsroman. Die verschiedenen Teile werden dabei mit ausgewogener Länge bedacht, wenngleich dem ganzen Buch (wie vielen Romanen) im ganzen 50 Seiten weniger gut getan hätten.

Die psychologische Charakterisierung der Figuren ist intelligent, tiefgründig und hochwertig. Die Schilderung sozialer Missstände gelingt nicht ganz so packend, hinterlässt aber an vielen Stellen trotzdem Eindruck. Gut gelingt die ambivalente, facettenreiche Schilderung der Wahrnehmung von Süden (der nicht simpel verklärt wird) und Norden (der nicht einhellig verdammt wird). Sprachlich ist es hochwertig und weitestgehend sehr angenehm zu lesen. Eine Sprache, die poetisch, anregend und bezaubernd ist, aber nicht zu abgehoben oder intellektuell degoutant (hat mich an die 'Buddenbrooks' erinnert, wenn auch nicht ganz auf dem Niveau). An der ein oder anderen Stelle ist das Englisch dadurch mal nicht ganz einfach, v.a. im Fall von längeren Sätzen (man sieht hier mal, wie es Engländern mit der deutschen Sprache mit ihren vielen langen Sätzen gehen muss). Richtig schwierig sind z.T. die Dialoge mit Personen aus der Arbeiterklasse, weil hier deren Dialekt nachgeahmt wird (wobei ich so doof war, erst nach der letzten Seite zu merken, dass sich auf den letzten zwei Seiten ein Glossar mit Übersetzung der am übelsten Dialektausdrücke in echtes Englisch befindet). Im ganzen für Liebhaber von Literatur aus dem 19.Jahrhundert eine absolute Empfehlung. Margaret Hale, the beautiful young daughter of a clergyman, is uprooted from her father's Hampshire rectory in the south of England when he decides he is unable to make a fresh declaration of conformity to the Liturgy and, in consequence, makes the decision to leave the church. Mr Hale resigns his position and takes his daughter and his delicate wife (who is totally shocked and distressed by her husband's decision) and moves them to Milton, an industrial town in the north of England. At Milton, Mr Hale takes on a tutoring role, which brings him into contact with factory owner John Thornton, a self-made man and an individual (and all that he stands for) whom Margaret takes exception to at their first meeting. In comparison with the south of England, Margaret and her mother find the northern town of Milton dirty and smoky and find the local people brash and uncultured; Margaret is also dismayed at the poverty in which the factory workers and their families are forced to live. However, she soon realizes it is up to her to make the best of the situation she finds herself in and she begins to take an interest in the local workers, which leads her into befriending a young woman and her father, Nicholas Higgins, a factory worker, who is involved with the unions and ready to take the workforce out on strike. Margaret's involvement with the Higgins family and her concerns about the living conditions of the working-class in Milton, brings her into further conflict with mill-owner John Thornton - who, by now, finds himself deeply attracted to Margaret, despite her attitude towards him. As time passes and Margaret and her family find themselves in some very difficult circumstances, Margaret's view of John Thornton gradually begins to change and she starts to see him in a new light, but then a situation arises, the consequences of which threaten to ruin their growing understanding of one another and spoil their chances of any sort of meaningful relationship.

Published in 1855, Elizabeth Gaskell's 'North and South' with its themes of power and authority, and of gender and social inequality, has been compared with Charlotte Bronte's 'Shirley' for its depiction of the struggles of the workers against the mill owners, and Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' for its portrayal of the combination of antagonism and attraction experienced between the two main characters, and I can understand why this novel has been thus compared - however, Miss Gaskell has her own story to tell, she tells it in her own way and she tells it particularly well. I first read this novel many years ago when I was a teenager and feel I have derived much more from it by this second visit, finding it an involving and very interesting read. At 500 or so pages, this is certainly not the longest of the classics, but if you feel you might not have the time to devote to it, do consider downloading the Audible audio version:, which is very ably narrated by Juliet Stevenson and which you can enjoy listening to 'on the go' or whilst getting on with something else.

5 Stars. This is my favorite novel of all the books I've read trough my life. It's a witty novel, delightfully written. The construction of the characters, each one in their own side of the story is very strong. Margaret is an admirable young woman very worthy or probable to have caught the attention of the sombre and lustrous mister Thornton, a man that although prided himself in self-denial, had to have Margaret once he intuited she would respond affirmatively. The conditions depicted of the various classes of society in Victorian England depicted here are invaluable. Well, what's not to love about this? Un excellent roman de Mrs Gaskell que j'avais lu il y a quelques années. L'intrigue rappelle l'orgueil et préjugés de Jane Austen mais a l'epoque de la révolution industrielle qui est très bien décrit. Ce roman est aussi très bien adapté par la BBC en 2005. Ayant perdu mon exemplaire, j'ai hâte de me replonger dans ce roman. Set in the times of the Industrial revolution in England, North and South is undoubtedly one the best classics I have ever read. We all know Jane Austen, yes she's great, agreed. But I feel that Gaskell never actually got the recognition she deserved for penning this masterpiece, even well after a hundred years since it's publication, owing partly to a few bad reviews from a few sexist critics, who were obviously not amused by Margaret's (our Heroine) rigorous exercise of her free will and ""haughty"", talk-back-to-men-attitude, and partly because it was a Woman writer, writing a book about a female heroine. Do the maths. Needless to say, she's a bit of a badass.
The Novel itself is set in a fictional town of Northern England, Milton, to where Margaret Hale grudgingly relocates, relinquishing her most beloved home in the rural south, hence the name, North and South. Margaret's general disdain for the Industrialised North and her tendency to sympathise with the poor and to encourage them to lead a better life, clashes with the indifferent attitude of John Thornton, a wealthy manufacturer, who rules his cotton mill with an iron fist, and whose contemptuous attitude towards his workers, leads Margaret to despise him even more. It's in Milton that Margaret witnesses the first workers strike and it's repercussions. For the facts mentioned before, I hardly consider this novel a love story. This book manages to present us with many dimension of human emotions and their complexities. How Margaret and John learn to accept differences in opinions and in return gain something entirely unexpected. And since love obviously triumphs all differences, this is ultimately a love story, and a good one at that. We need to have more characters like them in Modern literature today, as opposed to the Twilight Trash.
A happy or sad ending? It's actually quite a surprise and I totally love the ending. I love this book so much that even though I have a hardbound copy of it, I ordered one on Kindle as well, because I would like to carry it with me on my travels. Lovers of Jane Austen and the Bronte sisters are sure to love this one!
I love the writing and the dialogue and the awkward exchanges between the characters, especially between our two leads. They are quite adorable to be honest. And I love how Gaskell shows us multiple point of views, not just of Margaret, and that's what makes this book so great. After reading the book I highly recommend the TV series as well. Cheers, Have fun reading!!"
Hamlet (AmazonClassics Edition),"When Prince Hamlet returns home to Elsinore Castle for his father’s funeral, he discovers that his uncle Claudius has already crowned himself king. Hamlet begins to suspect something is indeed rotten in the state of Denmark, and a visit from his father’s ghost confirms it. Hamlet vows to avenge his father’s murder, but his consuming obsession yields only crushing grief, overwhelming rage, and a descent into madness.
Resonating with every generation over the centuries, Shakespeare’s profoundly chilling family drama is among the most quoted works from the Shakespearean canon.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Hamlet, this edition of Hamlet (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. The book is well bound and the print is small, but clear and easy to read. The play speaks for itself through all the centuries of its publication and all the thousands and thousands of productions that have flesh it out. There are excellent illustrations and it fits in my pants pocket. This is like an actual keepsake. I love carrying it around with me and to read ""At Will"" (pun intended). As a student diving into Shakespeare's world for the first time, ""Hamlet"" from the Folger Library Shakespeare collection has been an absolute revelation. This edition not only provides the timeless play in its authentic form but also enriches the experience with insightful annotations and context that breathe life into the intricate language.

The character of Hamlet came alive in ways I couldn't have imagined, thanks to the meticulous footnotes that helped me navigate the language and grasp the subtle nuances. The additional materials, including essays and historical information, were like a backstage pass to the playwright's mind, enhancing my understanding of the play's depth and relevance.

Whether you're a Shakespeare novice or a seasoned enthusiast, this edition caters to all levels of readers. It's not just a book; it's a gateway to a world of tragedy, philosophy, and human emotion. ""Hamlet"" from the Folger Library Shakespeare collection has truly made literature come alive for me, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone seeking a transformative literary journey. On a dark winter night, a ghost walks the ramparts of Elsinore Castle in Denmark. Discovered first by a pair of watchmen, then by the scholar Horatio, the ghost resembles the recently deceased King Hamlet, whose brother Claudius has inherited the throne and married the king’s widow, Queen Gertrude. When Horatio and the watchmen bring Prince Hamlet, the son of Gertrude and the dead king, to see the ghost, it speaks to him, declaring ominously that it is indeed his father’s spirit, and that he was murdered by none other than Claudius. Ordering Hamlet to seek revenge on the man who usurped his throne and married his wife, the ghost disappears with the dawn.

Prince Hamlet devotes himself to avenging his father’s death, but, because he is contemplative and thoughtful by nature, he delays, entering into a deep melancholy and even apparent madness. Claudius and Gertrude worry about the prince’s erratic behavior and attempt to discover its cause. They employ a pair of Hamlet’s friends, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to watch him. When Polonius, the pompous Lord Chamberlain, suggests that Hamlet may be mad with love for his daughter, Ophelia, Claudius agrees to spy on Hamlet in conversation with the girl. But though Hamlet certainly seems mad, he does not seem to love Ophelia: he orders her to enter a nunnery and declares that he wishes to ban marriages.

A group of traveling actors comes to Elsinore, and Hamlet seizes upon an idea to test his uncle’s guilt. He will have the players perform a scene closely resembling the sequence by which Hamlet imagines his uncle to have murdered his father, so that if Claudius is guilty, he will surely react. When the moment of the murder arrives in the theater, Claudius leaps up and leaves the room. Hamlet and Horatio agree that this proves his guilt. Hamlet goes to kill Claudius but finds him praying. Since he believes that killing Claudius while in prayer would send Claudius’s soul to heaven, Hamlet considers that it would be an inadequate revenge and decides to wait. Claudius, now frightened of Hamlet’s madness and fearing for his own safety, orders that Hamlet be sent to England at once.

Hamlet goes to confront his mother, in whose bedchamber Polonius has hidden behind a tapestry. Hearing a noise from behind the tapestry, Hamlet believes the king is hiding there. He draws his sword and stabs through the fabric, killing Polonius. For this crime, he is immediately dispatched to England with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. However, Claudius’s plan for Hamlet includes more than banishment, as he has given Rosencrantz and Guildenstern sealed orders for the King of England demanding that Hamlet be put to death.

In the aftermath of her father’s death, Ophelia goes mad with grief and drowns in the river. Polonius’s son, Laertes, who has been staying in France, returns to Denmark in a rage. Claudius convinces him that Hamlet is to blame for his father’s and sister’s deaths. When Horatio and the king receive letters from Hamlet indicating that the prince has returned to Denmark after pirates attacked his ship en route to England, Claudius concocts a plan to use Laertes’ desire for revenge to secure Hamlet’s death. Laertes will fence with Hamlet in innocent sport, but Claudius will poison Laertes’ blade so that if he draws blood, Hamlet will die. As a backup plan, the king decides to poison a goblet, which he will give Hamlet to drink should Hamlet score the first or second hits of the match. Hamlet returns to the vicinity of Elsinore just as Ophelia’s funeral is taking place. Stricken with grief, he attacks Laertes and declares that he had in fact always loved Ophelia. Back at the castle, he tells Horatio that he believes one must be prepared to die, since death can come at any moment. A foolish courtier named Osric arrives on Claudius’s orders to arrange the fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes.

The sword-fighting begins. Hamlet scores the first hit, but declines to drink from the king’s proffered goblet. Instead, Gertrude takes a drink from it and is swiftly killed by the poison. Laertes succeeds in wounding Hamlet, though Hamlet does not die of the poison immediately. First, Laertes is cut by his own sword’s blade, and, after revealing to Hamlet that Claudius is responsible for the queen’s death, he dies from the blade’s poison. Hamlet then stabs Claudius through with the poisoned sword and forces him to drink down the rest of the poisoned wine. Claudius dies, and Hamlet dies immediately after achieving his revenge.

At this moment, a Norwegian prince named Fortinbras, who has led an army to Denmark and attacked Poland earlier in the play, enters with ambassadors from England, who report that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. Fortinbras is stunned by the gruesome sight of the entire royal family lying sprawled on the floor dead. He moves to take power of the kingdom. Horatio, fulfilling Hamlet’s last request, tells him Hamlet’s tragic story. Fortinbras orders that Hamlet be carried away in a manner befitting a fallen soldier. My favorite part is when hamlet dies and when we finish the book. I also liked when i was writing a review it asked if a wanted to follow William Shakespeare and i am i. Little confused how William is posting… soooo ... which is best summarized in the pithy formulation that is a principal ""takeaway"" from this classic Shakespearean play: ""To be or not to be, that is the question."" Indeed, it is a gloomy play, with more than one character wondering if life is really worth it. The play commences with a ghost, who is Hamlet's father, who has returned to haunt the living, since he was murdered - by his brother, who is now the King. Furthermore, the reader learns early on, the wife of the now dead King quickly marries the new King; no ""decent interval"" required. And yes, she is the mother of Hamlet. That's the setup; Cliff Notes, as it has for generations of students, can walk you through the rest of the plot. I'll only add that not many of the principals are left standing at the end.

And like those aforementioned generations of students, I was once one myself, though now I am ""way past school."" And like the vast majority of students, those Shakespearean school reading assignments rather perversely instilled a desire never to read Shakespeare again. At a very real level, one is just too young in high school to ""get it."" And the ""stilted"" language of the English of the Middle Ages only makes it harder. Perhaps the only way to instill a desire to read him in school would be to forbid it.

I've been re-reading a number of works that I had to read in school, to see how the work and my perception of it have aged. ""Hamlet"" is a re-read. Now I've been able to observe, over several decades, the ""craziness"" that seems to come to people with power, as well as those who desire it. I now have known those who have died, and might call out for vengeance from beyond the grave. And I have observed the angst and indecisiveness in others, as so well depicted in the character of Hamlet. Ophelia, the young woman who Hamlet may have loved, has become a symbol for troubled young women, and she has lent her name to the title to a book or two. And there were some very famous women who followed her path, such as Virginia Woolf. I also know a few very real Danes, but they are far from angst-ridden.

The most famous soliloquy, ""To Be...,"" I mentioned earlier. It has been decades since I thought of that famous contemplation of death: ""Alas, poor Yorick!- I knew him well..."" Also, for decades, I've made references to getting something done ""before we shake off this mortal coil"" thinking it was probably somewhere in the Bible - but it turns out it was from Hamlet. And I thought Ben Franklin had said: ""Neither a borrower or a lender be,"" so I was surprised to also find it in Hamlet. And then there were those I hadn't remembered or attributed, correctly or not, such as: ""What is a man, If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more...""

Overall, the re-read was a great experience. And it is now so easy to download the plays, one at a time, for under a buck, unto the Kindle. I've set myself a goal of trying to read one a month, starting with the re-reads of the major tragedies, and then on to some of the comedies and histories which I had not read before. For Hamlet, 5-stars. Back in the late 60's, I saw a movie version of Hamlet at the Odeon theatre in my hometown. I looked up Hamlet productions on the IMDB and find that it was likely the 1989 movie with Nicol Williamson as Hamlet. I had taken five Shakespeare plays in high school but not Hamlet. I was unfamiliar with the play beyond the usual quotations from it. I didn't understand a word of it. Looking at the commentary on the Internet, I find that I was not alone in this. William spoke in a thick brogue and very quickly. At the time, I put up my lack of understanding as a lack of capability on my part. Hamlet was for other people who had a more subtle intelligence than mine.

Imagine my surprise then when I saw Kenneth Branagh’s four-hour movie version of the uncut play. This was fast moving, exciting, insightful and powerful drama interspersed with some very funny comedy. Hamlet was completely accessible even to someone like me. Perhaps, it wasn’t me who was lacking subtlety but the previous versions of the play that I had seen with their cuts and impenetrable dialog were the things that were lacking subtlety. These were productions of a meta-Hamlet. People could be familiar with the play and recognize parts of it in the production and appreciate the play and the production in that way.

Given my experience with Branagh’s version, I looked forward to reading the play as part of my project to read all the literature that I was assigned to read in school but didn’t. I’ve read my five high school plays and have moved on to attempt to read as many of the plays as possible. I found the Folger editions of the plays and with their side-by-side notes. I’ve found that I can read these plays with what I think is some degree of understanding. Each Folger edition has a brief essay on the play from a modern perspective. The Hamlet essay pointed out that the interpretation of the play has changed markedly over the centuries. Earlier critics looked at the personality of Hamlet and found him to be someone who was not capable of dealing with the issues that he faced. The author of the Folger essay points out that modern critics look more to the society in which the action takes place. They see an analog of the modern surveillance state in the actions of the characters to constantly spy on each other’s actions.

The Danish court in Hamlet is one in which there is no common purpose. Characters vie with character for advantage. Each is out for his own benefit and are indifferent to the consequences of their ambition on others. Claudius murders the king and conspires to kill Hamlet multiple times. Hamlet is indifferent to the deaths of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and the pain to which he put Ophelia. Hamlet is a revenge play, but it is a revenge play in which those seeking revenge are as lacking as their enemies. The Folger edition says that the play can carry many readings and that is the reading that it carries for me. I have seen this in some other Shakespeare Plays. The Henry IV plays argue against the ambitions that cause the death and famine of internecine wars.

Hamlet carries a play within a play that mimics the Danish court. However, for me, the Danish court is also a play that carries on in its own action indifferent to the factors of the real world. The players conspire against each other while in the real world the army of Fortinbras approaches to destroy the artificial world that they create among themselves. In this, I see the essential weakness of the surveillance state. We are faced with this same issue today as Shakespeare pointed out in his own time. Self-interest and suspicion breed only pain, hinger and death. The society they enable is unstable. It has no centre and cannot hold. Excelente produto Shakespeare es de los mejores dramaturgos, sin duda, y ésta es una hermosa edición de Hamlet. Hamlet est le second recueil le plus connu de Shakespeare après Roméo et Juliette . C'est pourquoi je me suis dit qu'il était préférable de l'acheter pour en savoir plus sur son style et son expression afin d'affiner ma culture littéraire . William Shakespeare`s Hamlet muss man nicht mehr rezensieren. Dazu ist wohl alles gesagt.Obwohl es immer wieder aufschlußreich ist, eine fundierte und persönliche Stellungnahme zu lesen. Unter den Rezensionen hier halte ich einige für sehr lesenswert. Außerdem darf und soll jeder seine ganz eigene Meinung zu diesem Thema haben und darstellen. Jeder erlebt Hamlet wieder neu und vielleicht auch anders.
Was mich vom vom ""Hocker"" haut, um es mal deudeutsch zu sagen, ist die Tatsache, daß ich mir die Originalversion für gerade mal 0,89 Cent so nebenbei auf mein Kindle ziehen kann. Dazu Goethe`s Faust für 0,00 Cent, also umsonst.
Man hat diese Werke immer dabei und kann mal wieder reinschauen, wenn einem danach zumute ist."
The Scarlet Letter (AmazonClassics Edition),"The red letter A on her dress marks young mother Hester Prynne among her Puritan neighbors, who demand to know who fathered her child. Rumors swirl, but the shunned and shamed Hester keeps her secret—and his—for years, until a guilt-ridden confession reveals the truth, with unexpected consequences.
Set in seventeenth-century Massachusetts, Hawthorne’s masterwork was originally subtitled “a romance,” though its themes include the limits of law, the power of religion, and the nature of sin. Equal parts tragic love story and social commentary, The Scarlet Letter brings to life the undying human need to keep secrets.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Scarlet Letter, this edition of The Scarlet Letter (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Great listen/read through Kindle Unlimited. A classic that makes you think about what you’re reading and challenges your preconceived notions of what the world should be. With sentiments and ideas that still resonate in today’s society. I read this in high school many years ago. Not sure if it is still part of the 21st century high school curriculum, if it isn’t, it should be reintroduced. Just look at a portrait of him as a young man, note the noble brow, the handsome features, the sensitivity, how romantic......... Curl up with this book and let Nathaniel tell you his tale in his beautiful poetic language . This is a book to be read quietly, alone, not in an airport lounge or on the subway, but preferably in a beautiful garden or sunroom with the windows open. Let the beauty of his language flow over you and transport you back in time.

It is over 200 years since Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in Salem Massachusetts, his great great grandfather officiated at the Salem Witch Trials. He was both disturbed and intrigued by his ancestry. One day when working at The Custom House in Salem to make ends meet as a struggling young author, he discovered in one of the upstairs rooms some dusty old boxes, on opening them he found them to contain relics from the past, long since forgotten. Yellowing documents and an intriguing piece of embroidery, a scrap of faded and torn material with the letter A embroidered on it. He picked it up, and while wondering what it was, he held it up to his chest, and at that moment he claims to have felt a burning sensation which caused him to drop the piece of cloth. It gave him inspiration for this story along with documents he found about a woman called Hester Prynne.

The scene he sets so vividly is somewhere around 350 years ago 150 years before he was born. In a time when behavior to which we can hardly be bothered to raise an eyebrow was in that day considered a punishable sin. A disgrace for life. Branded by having to wear a scarlet letter on the chest for all to see.

It is a feminist novel, (Nathaniel Hawthorne supported women's rights). Briefly, the protagonist Hester Prynne has a child from an adulterous relationship and refuses to name the father. Her husband a physician much older than she has never been a ""proper"" husband to her so she had looked elsewhere for love. The husband vows to find the father of the child, and in exchange for her freedom makes Hester swear she will never disclose who her husband is. Her husband being a physician quickly deduces who the father is from the way he is wasting away under his burden of guilt. He sets about a long period of torment of the young man of which Hester is aware but can say nothing because of her promise. Finally she has had enough and decides to come clean, shaming the devil, (her husband) and redeeming the young man. I do not want to spoil anything by divulging the name of the father of the child in case you do not know.

This is such a simple and brief account it would make Nathaniel wince to read it. There is so much more to the story. It states in the blurb that it is a psychological novel before there was a science called psychology. The way the characters in the story interact with each other, the symbolism, the different values of the day from Nathaniel's day, and then again to this day. The religious aspect in Puritan times, the emotional ups and downs as you empathize with first one and then another of the characters. It is a wonderful story and well deserving of its position as one of America's great classics. I figured out why I hated this book so much in high school:

First and foremost, the pretentious, overly-long syntax. I can imaging Hawthorne today as that guy who *is* very smart, but wants everybody to know how smart he is by the way he speaks, using extensive and seldom-used vocabulary. He clearly realizes that his syntax is too long because he often has to begin a sentence a second time in the middle of the sentence. He's taken so long to get to the point that even he has to go back to the beginning. The effect of all this language and detail is stunning, but it often takes so long to read because of its loquaciousness, that the reader may often get bored and simply want him to be done with it.

Additionally, I've always preferred dialogue over straight narration. There is precious little dialogue overall in this book. The details were lost on me. I really don't know how to analyze why or what I got out of dialogue that I didn't with Hawthorne's style. Perhaps it all had to do with feeling as though the narrative was moving forward. Again, Hawthorne's bombastic style must have made me feel stuck in the muck of details, mostly having to do with emotions, which I had little reference for appreciation.

What I remember most disliking, however, was a feeling of great frustration over not understanding how Pearl was supposed to symbolize the most precious thing God could give Hester after trading a respected place in her community. Personally, to be ostracized and isolated was - and perhaps still is - the worst form of punishment. At that age especially, physical pain would have been far more preferable a form of penance than forsaking all other pleasant peer interaction. Pearl, then, the living embodiment of the parable, is supposed to be this perfect thing for which all earthly goods, wealth, treasure, what-have-you, is supposed to be a perfect thing, worthy of such a trade. Pearl. Is. Weird. She is not sympathetic to her mother's woes, she is freaky intelligent, much more so than any child her age should be, which seemed to me at the time I first read the book to be downright ... Just freaky. I couldn't sympathize with her, and I liked kids! This kid was beyond my comprehension. She was weird, and I felt like Hester got a bad deal. I get it now. I get that Pearl is meant to be other-worldly until the minister finally confesses and reveals himself. Pearl had constantly asked him to do as much and was denied repeatedly. The confession broke the spell that they seemed to be under, and Pearl suddenly became a normal, loving child. I may have more to say yet on this matter, but for now, I am at work and feel compelled to move on.

Today, I have a better appreciation, but I still think the style is a bit ridiculous. It's impressive, to be sure. His symbolism and tension building is well-wrought. His characterization is sublime.

But Pearl is still weird! Já fiz outras compras internacionais na Amazon e nunca tive problema, mas dessa vez o pacote foi possivelmente extraviado e eu não recebi o livro na data correta. De qualquer forma, entrei em contato com o atendimento ao consumidor e eles me enviaram outro, que chegou uma semana antes do prazo.

Quanto ao livro, é uma das edições mais bonitas que eu já vi. Ele é menor do que parece, mas tem um acabamento bem trabalhado, detalhes da capa em relevo e folhas brilhosas que parecem durar bastante. Estou encantada! Quero adquirir os outros da coleção também kkk このオックスフォードのシリーズは注釈、解説が充実していますので、研究者的なくどさを感じる面もありますが、読み進める上では参考になります。
ただ、誤植が何カ所か（例えばnotがhotになったり、それなりに別の単語に化けています）あり、ただでさえ19世紀の英語で苦労しているところへ持ってきて、突然意味不明の文に遭遇して焦る羽目に陥ります。それを勘案すると、残念ながらあまりお勧めできません。 It gets you endulged in the story. Loved the descriptive quality of the author Muy buena edición y libro, la portada es de cartón fino por lo que se puede doblar con facilidad.
El tamaño es algo mas pequeño que un folio A5 pero está bien ya que no pesa y lo puedes llevar contigo. El texto está algo pegado para mi gusto, pero se puede leer fácilmente.
En general recomiendo este artículo.

Really good book and edition, the cover comes in paper format so you can easily bend it.
The size is slightly smaller than a blank page but it's alright as it is not heavy and you can carry it with you. Overall, the text is a little bit small for my liking, but it's very easy to read.
I highly recommend this product. top"
Meditations (AmazonClassics Edition),"Marcus Aurelius, one of the great rulers of the Roman Empire, sets forth a series of self-reflective essays intended as a guide for his own self-improvement. Written during the turning points of his life and divided into twelve books, Meditations ponders life’s greatest questions in the author’s search for a meaningful existence. Remarkably, they are no different from the questions we ask ourselves today—from finding happiness to understanding our place in the cosmos.
Centuries after Aurelius’s death, Meditations remains a profound source of inspiration for contemporary times—a collection of deeply held principles that are a wellspring for positive thinking and leading a purpose-driven life.
Revised edition: Previously published as Meditations, this edition of Meditations (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I was researching an historical author online and Marcus Aurelius's name came up as one of his inspirations and I decided to take a closer look at him also. ""A king that shares my own first name, I have to see what this is about"" I thought to myself. So I found ""Meditations"" and marked it to be read. Now I have to make this clear immediately, I hated this book! Let me clarify before you jump to conclusions, die hard fans of ""Meditations"". What I mean is that I hate that I love this book so much! Now there are things in life that people love to hate. There are things in life that are so outrageously obnoxious that you have to tune in just to see what happens next. This is a book that I hate to love and that's a first for me. This book will forever harbor a special place in my heart, and even if I'm out and I'm not in possession of a physical copy literally, it's divine principles and virtuous insight will reside in my heart figuratively. Now here is where I elaborate on what I mean by I hate (to love) this book. The fact that it took me three days to read this book when it would've taken three hours had it been any other book, on account of the fact that I found myself constantly pausing to meditate while pondering what I was in reading in a book that just happens to be entitled ""Meditations"" was just downright eerie to me! When I begin to delve into these very deep issues and encounter his profound insight in regards to them, it became impossible to simply breeze through them as anticipated. Now if it wasn't already eerie enough that my name is Marcus and I'm reading the diary of a man; a king whose name just happens to be Marcus also, and not only are these his inner most personal thoughts, that may have quite possibly been intended to be a private note to himself, but there were also certain parts that totally felt like fate as I came across them. It literally felt like certain things were specifically laid out for me...a very eerie feeling to say the least.

This book is outrageously good! There are absolutely NO DULL MOMENTS in this book! It really felt like Marcus was pressed for time and didn't have a moment to spare, and he was absolutely determined to diligently contain these wonderful conceptions and document them before they were lost forever. He did an excellent job, and I found every bit of what I read to be excellent and extremely helpful. I must admit that certain parts were so good that it angered me a little. ""How could this guy be so great""! I thought to myself. It was like someone vehemently addressing the issues that we all face at some point in life, and extracting them individually one by one and presenting them to me to be examined. It was literally like he took life's pain: love, the loss thereof, jealousy, envy, betrayal and death, and intentionally put pressure on all those wounds, but only for the purposes of assessment though. Then afterwards going to work on them, going in serious depth and detail about them all with such a gentle, pleasant, and appropriate empathy that it became impossible to remain upset about it. It was refreshing to know that someone cared enough to actually give an analysis about these things. The issues he explored, the conclusions drawn, really hit me as hard as a punch directly to the heart. It didn't feel like an attack though, more like CPR. Even though CPR hurts it's vital and for the better in the end. Now mind you ""Meditations"" is this man's note to himself, so he unintentionally affected me. I can't be mad at him for that. It was like having a heart to heart with someone who has the courage and is considerate enough to offer you an alternative in regards to any character flaws you may have, and ultimately challenges you to be better. As irritating as that can be, it hurts so good because you know it's coming from a place of love and that that person genuinely wishes the best for you, and is not patronizing you or being condescending in any way. If a woman were to have expressed this kind of genuine concern for me in regards to the interactions we shared with each other, I would fall madly in love with her instantly afterwards. If any couple were to express this kind of openness and genuine concern for one another I bet they would never part. The fact that is fashioned as if it were a diary only adds to the purity and importance of it, making it a sacred experience for me. I truly don't believe that a man who was this knowledgeable and articulate, and diligent in his outlook on life would lie to himself. There is nothing watered down, fake, or half true at all here!

Marcus actually proceeded to address not only life but death also in the same body of work. The nerve of this dude! Death is usually an issue a person would either prefer to hurt about with no interference, or to just be left alone about it and be enabled to move on and forget about it. Marcus Aurelius, having loss both his parents at a young age, and then his wife also, that must have instilled a sense of entitlement in him by then I suppose. His analysis was excellent though, very brilliant! Reading such an excellent body of work compelled me to pose a couple of questions to myself. Will a person like myself ever be able to live up to these excellent standards? will I ever be able to attain this type of greatness? Marcus's ability to examine human nature is absolutely astounding! When everyone around you is angry, no matter where you reside, or what the circumstances maybe; you so desperately want to be angry also, naturally, but Marcus Aurelius is a man, a king, who stresses the importance of patience and temperance. Not only does he stress it, he also insist that patience and temperance are both collectively the ultimate symbol of strength, and only the strong survive where I come from.

The concept of individuality has pretty much vanished in these modern times. The insistence of taking moral inventory of one's self, being self-reliant, self-sufficient, and exercising self-control was highly emphasized throughout the entire book. Nobody is asking anybody to be perfect, we all have our flaws, and many of the things in this world are what they are and the reasonable response is to adapt and behave accordingly but ""See how the life of a good man suits you, the life of him who is satisfied with his portion of the whole, and is satisfied with his own just acts and benevolent disposition"". ""Does another do me wrong? Let him look to it. He has his own disposition and his own activity. I now have what universal nature wills me to have, and I now do what universal nature wills me to do"", this is sheer brilliance. Here you have an emperor, a real ruler of a culturally enriched nation with a refined legacy, yet this man never mentions his own wealth, not once! His only concern is his very essence and his genuine empathy for mankind. I find that to be very distinctive and honorable to say the least. This man really poured his heart and soul into this work and I greatly appreciate it. I recommend this book honestly to every man. I think every man should read this book at least once. I also recommend this book to anybody who has suffered some kind of loss, such as the death of a close family member or friend. I think this book would be very helpful to anyone who has experienced such a thing. I also recommend this book to anyone who is seeking a deeper level of understanding in regards to human nature, whether it be for the purposes of excelling in business or it be of a personal nature. Whatever the case may be, this man's insight will definitely assist you in filling any void you may have in your soul. Meditations' or 'Things unto Himself' is 90 pages of very small, lightly printed font. So, if you require glasses, additional lighting is advisable **Highly recommended otherwise. ** Consuming information from laptops has damaged my eyes and I miss the way real books smell. It's a classic quick read into enduring as a 'human being' and the Stoic philosophy. Mr. Longs translation has easy accessibility for all. It's loaded with wisdom from one of the Roman empires most famous Emperors. I find it great fun to read the thoughts of a leader from roughly 2000 yrs ago. Amazon really should separate the translations on this incredible work. Just like the Bible, the translations are NOT equivalent, and if you start out with the wrong one, you’ll probably never appreciate it. I have tried three of them so far (and I am not a scholar, just someone who wants to appreciate stoicism.)
I started with the cheap/free download on the Kindle store, the one whose cover is slightly green with a stone bust and yellow lettering, published by Prabhat. The translator isn’t clearly credited, but I think I confirmed in the back pages that it is by Causaubon, translated in 1634. This is similar to the King James Version of the Bible and Shakespeare. Since I was raised on KJV and Shakespeare, I have no problem with the “thee” and “thou” and “whatsoe’er”. I understand most of it, and it has a pleasing poetical authority, like reading the Psalms. Marcus rambles a little, too, so you really feel his stream of consciousness. There are places where the syntax, however, makes me say, “huh?” and reach for the next version.
The Hays translation is the one I would give to just about everyone. The ideas closely follow the Causaubon version, condensing them, losing the heft and stateliness, but pretty accurate and easy to read. Good for non-geeks. Teens could understand it, and any adult enjoy it.
I also tried the Gregory Long version (1862) but tossed it away. Too colloquial, and when compared to the others I would exclaim, “that’s not at all what Aurelius was trying to say!” Dumbed-down words with confusing syntax. Why bother?
The book itself is full of Stoic philosophy. Even if you aren’t religious, you can be philosophical, and Aurelius argues that is the highest state humans can achieve. If we are going to chuck religion as a nation, not many could object to the principles here as a replacement for current social law (as inoffensive as Buddhism). With Aurelius you learn people have been the very same for millennia, but the only constant for an individual is change. All we can do is run our own race with dignity and kindness. We control our minds and reactions. No one can take your spirit away but you. No wonder this text has been cited by so many leaders, POWs, and weary sufferers. Highly recommended. great book with lots of wisdom Truly enjoyed reading. This is one book I may like to read again. Also like to comparative study of this book and Bhagvad Gita. Because lots of teachings which I got from Bhagvad Gita, I found them in this book. Some of the quotes were bit contextual and hence could not comprehend. When I read again, I guess I will be able to understand them better. Worth keeping this as a reference book at home. A good edition at a great price! Das Buch ist einfach zu lesen und verstehen. Man muss nicht mal von der Seite 1 bis lesen, man kann auch in der Mitte was lesen und so hin und her ,das ist der Vorteil von der Weisheiten vom Inhalt des Buches. Awesome"
Great Expectations (AmazonClassics Edition),"Raised in squalor in the marsh country of Kent, the orphan Pip is taken under the wing of the eccentric and reclusive Miss Havisham—only to blindly give his heart to the dowager’s beautiful but ice-cold adopted daughter, Estella. Even as a mysterious benefactor helps to shape Pip’s life into one of fortune, success, and self-discovery, the unspeakable secrets of his unrequited love continue to haunt him—and promise to change his life once again.
With its indelible cast of characters, immersive epic narrative, and startling dramatic twists, Charles Dickens’s powerful classic continues to enthrall generations of new readers.
Revised edition: Previously published as Great Expectations, this edition of Great Expectations (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Dickens has such a gift of character development that exceeds most. He gives you such detail that you can truly feel you know this person. I am no writer so this review will not do justice.

What I loved about this was how the story and the characters were as applicable today as they were in Dickens time. The judgement of people different from us, the behavior of unrequited love, making bad decisions over and again.

There are characters that you feel deeply for and love and others you want to shake by the shoulders and others you wouldn’t mind if tragedy befell them.

Pip is a character that regardless of his status cannot seem to make a wise decision. Perhaps it is because he can only think of one person and has no space for no one else. Or, he is just selfish? Others suffer his mindlessness or selfishness with grace and mercy.

The ending was great in my mind because it isn’t what you might expect or want for the ending, but it is very real. This story could easily be as relevant today with the similar attitudes and people’s personalities. Thoroughly enjoyed this and highly recommend to anyone who loves true literature. Pip, the main character in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, writes the story in first person as a middle aged man looking back on his life. Pip's parents die when he is young making him an orphan. Pip is ""brought up by hand"" by his sister, who treats him with scorn. His sister's lack of love, however, is tempered by her husband Joe, a blacksmith. Joe is a simple, uneducated man and Pip's only ""friend"" during childhood. Pip commiserates with Joe about his sister's verbal thrashings, trying to make the best of his unhappy upbringing.

Early in the story, Pip has an encounter with a convict in the cemetery among the marshes near his home. Unbeknownst to him, this man would be the source for his ""Great Expectations"" later in life.
One day Pip is invited to the home of Ms. Havisham. Ms. Havisham is a single, eccentric, old woman who stopped living in the real world many years earlier when she was spurned by her lover on her wedding day.
Ms. Havisham has adopted the beautiful Estella, and from the moment Pip meets her, he is infatuated with her beauty. Estella represents wealth, education, success, and opportunity--things Pip values but thinks he will never have.
Dissatisfaction within himself grows as he wants to be more in life than a partner with Joe in the forge. Pip becomes unhappy not only with himself, but also with Joe, who represents what he does not want to be--uneducated and simple. Failing to appreciate Joe's moral character, Pip's world view begins to change as he sees education as something to be attained--the sure way out of his wretched life and the means by which he could woo the object of his unmerited affections, Estella.

Pip's life changes dramatically when he is visited by a well respected and fiercely admired lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who brings him an unusual message. Mr. Jaggers tells Pip he is to receive ""Great Expectations,"" but the benefactor is to remain anonymous until and only if they choose to reveal their identity. Pip mistakenly assumes the benefactor is Ms. Havisham, and the manipulating, self serving woman does nothing to dissuade him from his incorrect assumptions.
The story takes Pip to London where he lives a life of excess and discards many virtues from his childhood. He no longer wants anything to do with Joe and believes his future course has been immutably set--that he is to marry the beautiful Estella. He shares his indulgences with his new friend, Herbert, whose acquaintance he had made years earlier at Ms. Havisham's place. The two of them rack up excessive debt as Pip sees himself as ""a man in waiting"" for all his fortunes to come to pass.

Things are not what they seem, however. It is eventually revealed that the benefactor is not Ms. Havisham but the convict, Mr. Magwitch, whom Pip had met in the cemetery many years earlier when he was a young, impressionable boy.
Pip is confronted face to face with the despised convict, hounded by the remembrances of him torturing him in the cemetery, dreams that lingered, causing him much consternation. But now he has to accept the undeniable truth that his turn of fortune is not because of Ms. Havisham's provision, but the despicable convict's desire to make him a gentleman. The convict wants his life to be redeemed for something good and chooses Pip to be that vehicle.
Through a series of events, Pip acknowledges the inexcusable way he has treated Joe and wants to make amends. Before he can accomplish this, however, other happenings complicate his life. The convict, now in England, needs Pip's protection. Pip must make a way for Magwitch to leave England without being discovered.

While Pip hides him with a trusted friend, Pip comes to realize that the convict he had earlier despised has more redemptive qualities than Pip has within himself. As he makes provision for the convict's escape, Pip sees Magwitch change for the better, and in so doing, Pip also changes. Instead of hating the convict, Pip grows to love him. The self centeredness of Pip's indulgences is replaced with care, not only for the convict, but in growing degrees, for others.
In the process of trying to escape, the convict is attacked by his long-time archrival and enemy. As a result, Magwitch is severely injured, discovered by the authorities, put on trial and convicted, but dies from his injuries before his death sentence can be carried out. Magwitch's estate is turned over to the authorities to make restitution for past wrongs. Pip is left penniless and obligingly accepts that his Great Expectations and source of income have dissipated into nothing. Meanwhile, Estella marries someone else--a man whom Pip despises.

A few years earlier, Pip had secretly made arrangements for his friend Herbert to have a small expectation out of his ""Great Expectations,"" amounting to a sizable sum of money. When it becomes known to Pip that he will lose his ""Great Expectations"" to the authorities, his only thought is for his friend. Pip returns to visit Ms. Havisham and requests, in a show of repentance for the wrongs she had done to him, a sum of money that Pip could again secretly provide to Herbert.
Herbert wisely uses this money to successfully buy into a business venture. He later marries and moves overseas in his business pursuits--none of which would have been possible without Pip's anonymous provision to Herbert.
Pip credits this as the only redeeming thing he has accomplished, reflecting on all the other things he did or didn't do that could have been used for good.

Pip falls ill following the death of his convict friend, Magwitch, and Joe comes to England to care for him until he is well. Joe surreptitiously leaves early one morning when Pip is sufficiently recovered, and when Pip wakes up, he discovers Joe has paid off all his creditors. Pip immediately returns home in penitence to confess to Joe all his past wrongs, realizing that Joe is a better man than he. He recognizes in his now humble state that his ""Great Expectations"" deceived him into using it as a source of pride against Joe.

Upon arriving home, Pip's expectations are not what he envisioned. His sister who raised him by hand has long since died as a result of an attack on her by the evil Orlick. His childhood friend and confidant, Biddy, has just married Joe. In the end, redemption works its way for good. Joe and Biddy are happily married and the sore memories of Pip's sister are forgotten.
Pip returns to London and within a month, leaves England and joins Herbert's firm, Clarriker and Company, overseas. Pip lives abroad with Herbert and his wife, and after successfully making partner, eleven years later, returns to his boyhood home in England. He discovers Joe and Biddy now have a son who reminds him of himself.
Before bidding Joe and Biddy a final farewell, Pip makes one last trip to the Havisham place, the old woman having died many years earlier. Pip discovers Estella in the garden, a chance meeting since she no longer lives there. The old house and brewery have been torn down and sold off except for the garden enclosed by the ivy covered wall.
Years of a stormy, failed marriage have softened Estella's vindictive, prideful nature, and she confesses that ""suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.""
The reader is left to ponder whether Pip and Estella ever marry because Pip says, ""I saw no parting from her.""

In the end, Pip learns much about what matters--wisdom he would not have possessed if he had stayed working at Joe's forge. As a middle aged narrator looking back, there is sadness but sweetness about what he has lost because of what he has gained. Perhaps the reader is the real winner, having seen redemption on so many levels within each character. In the end, if we are honest, we can identify these shortcomings in ourselves. If Pip can work out his ""Great Expectations"" to bring redemption, perhaps we can, also--that is, again, if we are honest. Our sinful nature will always be there, but if we look for good, God will not disappoint us. Maybe ""Great Expectations"" will not only find us, but redemption will be there, too, just as it was in Pip. In middle school I was required to read this; I did so with considerable misery. As an adult I would like it better, but I didn't. I think the writing is excellent, the plot is coherent and that it is surely a great book but I still do not find it particularly interesting. To me, it reads like a soap opera. I was also required to read Moby Dick which I read with some misery. However on rereading Moby Dick as an adult I found it quite engaging.

In my opinion, Great Expectations is not at the level of Moby Dick. I am not certain which was the more prolific writer but I am certain that Melville was ""il miglior fabbro"". Perhaps Melville benefited from his friendship with Hawthorne. In that case, it is arguable that Hawthorne's most important contribution to literature was Herman Melville (which is what Faraday said of Maxwell). This is only the second Dickens novel I’ve read, the first being A Tale of Two Cities (and I guess A Christmas Carol if that counts, but it’s just a novella). There’s something very neat about the way everything ties together here, and at times while reading I felt like it was all a bit much. But once I’d finished, the impression it left on me as a whole was pretty profound. Pip was incredibly frustrating to begin with, as I guess Dickens intended. By the end, my heart really broke for him.

There was no surprise inheritance in the end, which was a bit…surprising - but it’s much better that way. Quality product for reasonable price. I am a secondary school English teacher. I was sick of squinting to read the tiny-fonted Wordsworth Classic edition whilst also trying to keep one eye on the pupils. A pupil would make a sound, so I would look up and instantly lose my place. I was also fed up of having to fight to make the small font visible under the visualiser. This book is brilliant! The font is size 18 and the line spacing is plenty big enough for annotations, should you decide to add them. There are only two disadvantages. The first is its lack of page numbers though I read ahead and add sticky notes on key pages anyway. Secondly, it is a BIG book but, so long as your desk is clear and tidy, that should not be an issue. Both my pupils and I think this book is great. What can one say? This is Charles Dickens I am writing about - one of the best novelists in the English language. Only that this one is one of his best. If you only ever read one Dickens novel, make it this one! There is a reason why there has been so many movie and TV adaptations of this story. Character, drama, violent action, plot twists. But you have to read the original words to get the full flavour, even if you already know the ending. And if you don't - here is a treat in store for you. Just like he did in A Christmas Carol, Charles Dickens emphasizes the importance of friends and family and the need to stay in touch with one's roots in the classic novel Great Expectations.

The story brilliantly depicts the evil side of money, how it changes a person. It is an extraordinary depiction of love, loyalty, and forgiveness, of false perceptions, and the derived sadness. The plot is slow at the beginning, but it picks up pace as the pages turn, only to keep the reader hooked to it.

As is always the case with Dickens' characters, they are vividly described in the prose. It is easy to fall in love with the positive ones, but the way he writes, makes one intricately understand the negative ones as well. And let's be honest, people are both good and bad, so there is always a gray area. Miss Havisham (a character in this book), for instance, is so eerily described that the reader is left unsure whether to love her or hate her - certainly can't just ignore her!

There is no doubting the genius that is Dickens. Few instances:

The subtlety by which he takes a jab at the way humans misuse religion is just wonderful:

""Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by their religion.""

How life is nothing but a chain of connected events, remove any one and the result would have been different:

""That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it is the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it, and think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.""

""life is made of ever so many partings welded together""

How those who are affectionate are weak. Or are they?

""It’s a weakness to be so affectionate, but I can’t help it. No doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn’t change my disposition if I could. It’s the cause of much suffering, but it’s a consolation to know I possess it, when I wake up in the night.""

On the importance of crying:

""Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts.""

The definition of real love:

“I’ll tell you,” said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper, “what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter—as I did!”

How looks are deceiving:

""Take nothing on its looks; take everything on evidence. There’s no better rule.""

Verdict: Highly recommended. Worth a re-read. This book is really fun and full of adventures and a really good price, so perfect Bueno"
The Iliad (AmazonClassics Edition),"After nine years fighting the Trojan War, the Greeks sense imminent defeat. The gods have cursed them with a plague; the Trojans have set their ships on fire; and their best warrior, the impenetrable Achilles, has turned his back on them. But when the Trojans go too far and kill Patroclus, his beloved brother-in-arms, Achilles returns to the battlefield with a vengeance so terrible that it shocks even the gods.
Written by Homer more than twenty-five hundred years ago, The Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature—the seminal epic narrative of infantry combat, the scars of battle, and the inevitability of fate.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Iliad, this edition of The Iliad (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. What can be said about this work? Yes, it is truly a foundational work of Western literature that deserves to be read, and, yes, this is an older translation that is written in a comparatively archaic form of English. On the other hand, who suggested that this would be a leisurely read, and, moreover, why should it be? Definitely, if you're looking for a condensed version of the Iliad or reading this for some college course, this isn't the version for you; however, if you're reading this because you want to learn or because you want to feel the depth of the work, this is a good translation: it retains as much of the basic structure as possible, but still remains readable in English, expressing the full range of emotions and giving descriptions down to the minor details. If reading this forces you to consult another resource in order to understand a character or google a word to better understand your own language, is that really such a bad thing? Best of all- it's free. I have read both `The Iliad` and `The Odyssey` as Kindle Amazon Classics edition.

Homer's `The Iliad` and `The Odyssey` are classic literature poems who needs no introduction. There a mix of Greek mythology and war/battle stories in a poem format (which doesn't make the easiest read for some audiences). I enjoyed reading the Kindle versions; I recommend reading it from a Kindle, the verses don't fit well smartphone screens. The translation was decent from my point of view, although I'm not an expert by any means.
Each of the `books` of the poem is introduced by an `argument` (basically a short snapshot of the story line), which is a nice touch. I would have liked to see some annotations with the Kindle versiond; although I'm somewhat familiar with Greek mythology and I have read `The Iliad` and `The Odyssey` before, the text requires extra detailing of some items/parts. It might sound a bit silly, but I do believe that this book is not ""just a book"".
Iliad by Homer is definitely one of the masterpieces for European Literature. In fact, Iliad is the foundational stone (amongst a few others) not only for European Literature but for the Western Civilization itself.
The one should read this epic poem at least once in its life in order to understand roots of European way of living, philosophical views of Greek and Roman philosophers who have become ""prophets"" for modern representatives of free mind. Good book, excellent option to read. I recommended that. Is a very good reading. Is a classic of the history. But now I know why everybody just reads excepts. Normally I can finish anything, but I couldn't. Maybe someone thinks this is amazing, but that someone isn't me. I had to put it down, and while I have loaded a LOT of books onto my Kindle, there are VERY few that I haven't slogged through to the end. We have a winner. Remind me of old times at school. A classic unmissable in your Kindle. The Iliad remains one of the most epic war stories of all time. This is a narrative about the glory of war, and the cost at which this comes, especially to families. The most interesting idea in my opinion, is fate. What would it mean for how we lived our lives and fought our wars if we knew our fate before they began? GREAT READ! It's the Iliad...
Read it! Reading this edition of the Iliad is a wonderfully poetic and uplifting experience. Perfeito When the war which saw the Greeks against the inhabitants of Troy was finished, with the complete destruction of Troy, few people escaped from Troy and sailed through the Mediterranean see and arrived where today is Rome.
The Hero who made this journey is Aeneas, a descendant of the King of Troy, who will experience many adventures before arriving in Italy. The book provides a good idea of the human beings' life, habits and feeling in the 8th Century before Christ. My word, what a difficult read. Always heard it was, but I love a challenge......."
The Prince (AmazonClassics Edition),"Direct and coldly pragmatic, Niccolò Machiavelli’s The Prince is the preeminent guide to winning and maintaining power at the highest levels, where deception and manipulation are necessary tools, and political allies should never be mistaken for friends.
Once a foreign policy official in his native Florence, Machiavelli was ousted by the Medici family. After surviving disgrace and torture at their hands, he penned The Prince to garner their favor. While this effort was ignored, the five-hundred-year-old work endures and is now considered one of the most influential—and controversial—political treatises of all time.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Prince, this edition of The Prince (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. After having read this delightful translation of The Prince, I want to return to one of my favorite cities in Italy -- Florence.

I don't know the Italian language except that I love hearing operas sung in Italian. (I studied a little Spanish in my younger days.)

This book is delightful to read for numerous reasons, among the primary ones are the author's instructive notes and translation that renders Machiavelli writing poetic and readily accessible -- it reads like contemporary writing with Italian operatic pageantry, marvel and excitement, which I believe accurately reflects Machiavelli's Renaissance Florence. Professor William J. Connell delivers the goods: ""Machiavelli's language is more immediate and much less abstract and 'impersonal' than commonly believed.""

By today's standards, the lessons captured by Machiavelli in The Price are not earth-shattering and seem almost over-simplified. Yet, they will likely continue to resonate for centuries to come because Machiavelli captured the essence of human instincts, needs, desires and aspirations. Politics and governance involve harnessing all available resources through human beings. And in warfare, the United States and allied forces realized the efficacy of winning the ""hearts and minds"" of the local people in Iraq and Afghanistan, which Machiavelli teaches in The Price.

In Chapter 19, Machiavelli instructs: ""the price should think . . . to avoid those things that could make him hateful and contemptible, and whenever he will avoid this thing, he will have fulfilled his duties and he will not find any peril at all in the other infamies. It makes him hateful . . . if he is rapacious and the usurper of the property and women of his subjects, from which he should abstain. And whenever he does not take away property or honor from the generality of men they live content.""

In Chapter 21, we get a lesson on (modern) Economics 101 from Niccolo Machiavelli:

""A prince must also show himself a lover of the virtues by giving hospitality to virtuous men, and he must honor those who are excellent in an art. Next, he must encourage his citizens to be able quietly to practice their trades, in commerce, in agriculture and in every other human occupation, so that one man is not afraid to improve his properties for fear they will be taken from him, and another is not afraid to open a business for fear of taxes. . . .[A]t the appropriate times of the year he should keep his people occupied with feast-days and spectacles. And because every city is divided into guilds and wards, he should take account of those collectives, meet with them sometimes, and offer himself as an example of humanity and munificence, while nonetheless always keeping firm his dignity's majesty[.]""

Machiavelli observes: ""And men as a whole judge more with their eyes than their hands, because everyone is permitted to see, but few are permitted to touch. (Ch. 18.)

Machiavelli cautions: ""For even if you have fortresses, if the people hold you in hatred, the fortresses do not save you, since outsiders who will help them are never lacking for the people once they have taken up arms."" (Ch. 20.)

Professor Connell makes Machiavelli (and Italy's history) come alive; his translations make The Price accessible and delightful to read. This work is a book in its own right and I expect it will remain accessible to many future generations of readers. This book is certainly timeless. Very well made book, perfect size, good quality, and easy to follow.

Really enjoyed reading this and I think it has some very important notes for men. A bit difficult to read because the sentences were long and quite complicated. So I had to read slowly and it probably took three times longer, but there were quite a lot of valuable life advice, so it wasn't wasted by any means The idea of ""reviewing"" this is more than a little silly -- it's arguably the most influential non-religious work of all time -- but I thought a few comments & historical notes might still be worthwhile.

""The Prince"" was essentially the first work of political realism in Western thought -- the first work of Western political philosophy that concerned itself not with the ideal government (as Plato had done in his _Republic_) but with the practical realities of getting and holding power. To describe the impact and influence of that willingness, that first notion that conventional morality might not be the best guide to success, would be as impossible a task as trying to summarize the influence of Galileo. Napoleon is rumored to have written extensive annotations to this book; Stalin allegedly kept a copy on his nightstand. Half of Shakespeare's villains (Iago, Richard III, etc.) derive their character in whole or part from this text.

Most of this book is extraordinarily controversial, even today, yet still fundamentally difficult to argue against; there's a reason the Catholic Church kept it on the _Index Librorum Prohibitorum_ for centuries. If you're looking for food for thought, it's here.

This particular kindle edition is fairly good; the text is cleanly presented with few typographical or scanning errors, and the translator has clearly made a significant effort to present the text as accurately as possible in a modern translation, with several footnotes detailing possible alternate translations of particular words, etc. In addition to the text of _The Prince_, this edition also includes two shorter historical works by Machiavelli, ""Descriptions of the Methods Adopted by the Duke Valentino When Murdering Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, the Signor Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini,"" and ""The Life of Castruccio Castracani of Lucca."" (""Duke Valentino"" is an alternate name for Cesare Borgia). Both additional texts are, in essence, case studies of how contemporary historical figures achieved success by acting according to the precepts which Machiavelli outlines in the main body of the text, and as such are very useful and interesting companion reads.

As a final note, if anyone has recommendations for histories of Italy in this time period, please link me to them in a comment -- after reading this, I want to read more about the era. Thanks! It's about what you would expect from a classic work that's basically an ancient self-help book. It was interesting to see where so many common self-help tropes have originated, but there really wasn't much that was groundbreaking for myself. The writing was interesting at times and less interesting at other times. It would probably be a good idea to know a bit of your European history before delving into this one or the references will be mostly lost on you. It prepares the reader through historic evidence of those days in present Italy, only to reveal itself as a manifesto for the next leader supreme who's going to unite all principalities into one country under God and get it off the claws of the surrounding barbarians.
It applies universally to personal life and career strategies that one can employ in today's world. Good edition. Having heard a lot about the book finally read it and it is still very relevant to the modern world perfect condition amazing Le livre com Tel est un chef d'oeuvre d'un homme d'état extraordinaire. J'ai acheté 3 éditions differentes - une pour garder et 2 pour offrir. J'ai comparer les traditions et il faut que j'avoue que je regrette de ne pas pouvoir le lire dans la langue originale. Meme la plus petite différence d'interprétation des differentes traducteurs peut changer la conception du texte. These are 500 years old advices, but they are still applicable."

Revised edition: Previously published as The Time Machine, this edition of The Time Machine (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Daniel Mundis - Book Project # 2
The Time Machine, by H.G. Wells, is a thrilling science fiction novel revolving around the story of a man only known as the ""Time Traveler.” Throughout the story the narrator does not reveal his name, nor do any of the other characters in the book. Neither does he reveal the name of the time traveler and many other guests that appear in the background. Everyone has a certain title for which they are known for. The story starts off with the “Time Traveler” inviting a couple intelligent people to a small gathering or party. He shows them a mock of what he believes to be a time machine. No larger than a cubic foot it was described as. He explained how everything was to work. How the universe was is a four dimensional realm with time being the fourth dimension and a plane that could be traveled across. After a short demonstration of how the miniature model worked, he stunned the audience leaving them with nothing but questions. After a short dinner and questions asked by the group, he invited them all back in a couple of weeks to another dinner.
Most of the previous group returned along with a few new people. The dinner started without the time traveler present. He was nowhere to be found at the moment. All of a sudden the door is slammed open with the time traveler walking through the door appearing to be extremely tired and somewhat injured. He says very little walks upstairs saying that he will redress and invites everyone down to the smoke room. After seating everyone and silencing any questions, he says that he has a story to tell. If anyone shall interrupt his story with a question, they should leave now for he will not tell it. Everyone is quiet and settled so he begins.
He starts off by saying how he finished his machine and how proud he was. He boards his machine to test it and experience what the future holds. He flips his switches and everything turns into a mist or dust. His chest was under immense pressure as he saw everything speed across his vision. Faster and faster things went and moved. Soon day and night went by so fast that it looked like a still picture. His dials for hundreds and thousands of years were moving quite quickly until eventually he felt that he could endure no more and turned it off. He stopped on the near end of the year 800,000. He walked out of a couple shrubs to be greeted by what looked like a large marble statue of a phoenix. He was rather amazed that there were no tall and momentous skyscrapers to be anywhere in site. He was dumbfounded at the small and decorative buildings that scattered across the hillside thought to be made by humans. He encounters a small and soft race of creatures that he believes to be an evolved human race. The gentle race greets him and shows him their common area and food source. As night approaches he decides to sleep in the new world. He sleeps outside away from the gentle creatures and wakes to his time machine having disappeared. He sees the drag marks on the ground from the large thing and deducts that it was dragged into the bronze plates on the base of the phoenix.
Frustrated he finds things to busy himself with. Days pass and he even saves a little creature from the current of the river. He thinks her name is weena and explores the landscape with her. They find wells dotting the landscape with air rushing in or out of them. He finds small plate like handles going down them and decides to leave weena for a moment and explore further. In the well it is pitch black with virtually no light to be seen. He lights a match to find these hideous pale white and fuzzy creatures. They have large eyes and scatter from the light leading the time traveler believe that they are nocturnal. When the light goes out the touch him and try to grab him, but the time traveler was faster and stronger. Able to fend off the creatures he hurriedly makes his way back up the well. He finds that the little creatures are also afraid of the darkness and the wells.
He makes his way with Weena to what looks like a green porcelain palace. Through further investigation he finds out that it is an ancient museum with many relics in airtight containers. He salvages what he could including more matches for he had used all of his. He finds a club like bar for a weapon and a tool to open the phoenix. As he makes his way out night falls upon them and tries to make his way to what he thinks might be safe area. The Creatures of the night befall upon them and it is a fight for him. Throwing explosive material and setting fires, he runs with weena.
Through the confusion he loses her but makes his way to the bronze phoenix with its doors open. As he suspected just after walking in, the doors close leaving him trapped. Fighting the creatures back he makes his way into the time machine’s harness and sets sail forward in time once again. Now the sun doesn't move and a moon is not in sight. Large cretaceous creatures are everywhere and try to kill the traveler. Forward in time more and more little changes until on his last trip forward the air is toxic making it very difficult for him to move. The only thing left in sight was the grass, the ocean, and the sun. He hurriedly makes his return lever activate and zooms back in time.
This is the end of the Time traveler's story and so he bids his guests goodnight. The narrator is left intrigued and asks a question or two after everyone leaves about how it was, and the response was a smile. The narrator goes to visit the traveler once more but he gone. Puzzled and wondering when, if ever he will return. The narrator then mentions that as he tells us this story it has been a couple years since the travelers disappearance.
I personally loved this book and implore anyone and everyone to read it. It was suspenseful and exciting. An extremely complex vocabulary with a couple great quotes to be mentioned, this short read was one of my favorites. I quite enjoyed how the author told this story from a unique point of view and left me wondering. This was a short story but as I have tried, it cannot be summarized into something small. This book captured my mind and made me excited about what cheery thing was going to happen next or what travesty was to befall upon weena and the traveler. I give this book and easy 4-5 star rating. Oh how I've missed reading the classics. I love them dearly, but I never seem to get around to reading them. They are truly wonderful and rarely do they ever disappoint, and this one certainly did not. I've been meaning to get around to reading something from HG Wells, so I decided upon the shortest one which also happened to be the one I've seen in movie form. I think this has definitely made my appetite for his writing grow so hopefully in the future I'll be reading War of the Worlds.

The Time Machine is one of those books that actually can transcend the time in which it was written. The time traveling plot actually makes the dated writing style fit perfectly, and actually made my reading experience better. It's also a relatively short and quick read, but given that the actual time frame in which this happened is also short it doesn't really detract from the story at all. The one thing that really took me a moment to get use to is the lack of actual names, our main character is The Time Traveler and other characters in his present day are known by similar titles. It doesn't really matter, as the real story has no call for his name and with the ending Wells gives you it really enriches the story. Who ever thought that not knowing the character's name would be a good thing? There is also a tremendous amount of scientific and philosophical thought that goes into this, and it really got me thinking about what will come after us and why.

The main story of time travel in this one is one that most are familiar with through at least some pop culture reference. Like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory, which probably my favorite spoof.
The story in itself is kind of a chilling realization. You have the kind, dainty and beautiful Eloi who live on the surface of the future Earth. They seem to live the perfect existence. Then you have the lurking, furry, and terrifying Morlocks who live beneath the surface with their machinery. The two races play pivotal role in each others lives and more importantly they play an even bigger role in showing an over the top example of what occurs when one section of human lifestyle distance themselves from another. In this case the seemingly wealthy and lap of luxury against the workers who are relayed upon and yet shunned. But if that's too much thinking for you, you have no need to fear the story is wonderful without all the insight, especially if you've seen the movie.

I would certainly recommend this to anyone with an interest science fiction and time travel. It's pretty short and only took me about a day to read so it's certainly not to much of a time consumer. Also if you haven't seen the original movie from 1960 go watch it, I haven't seen the newer one so I'm not sure about it. I loved reading this book. Wells had such a fanciful way of describing what no one has ever seen, but still beautifully making the fantasy perfectly graspable and tangible. Although, as with many of his books, mostly written in narrative, it is still astoundingly suspenseful and incredibly creative. Es muy buen libro, pese a que es un clásico, los temas que aborda siguen siendo actuales. La historia te atrapa desde un inicio y en mi opinion es uno de los mejores libros jamas escritos. La edición de pasta blanda es ideal para jóvenes lectores ya que es económica y pequeña pero si buscas una version que dure mas tiempo, considera comprar otra edición. Kitabın anlatımı güzel, notlar doyurucu, baskı kararları detaylı. Fiyat biraz can acıtır ama bu güzel hikayeye değer. Gelen üründe de herhangi bir sorun çıkmadı, afiyetle okudum. I fondly remember reading this and adored Wells writing. Beautifully written, classic, the original source of science fiction. Far beyond his time to imagine such things.

“Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave.”

The multiple theories between the learned men was fascinating.

For anyone who recalls reading of the Morlocks and Eloi, as a child, or watching the original movie, pick this up again. The basis for so many science fiction references—it remains one of few books able to engage me fully as a reader with fond memories.

I enjoyed being reminded of the beauty of words and novels I devoured growing up reading. The book itself is a phenomenal short novel, the story is very intriguing and is well written. The only thing I didnt like was the copy I bought, the copy's cover page was advertised differently when I bought it, but I wont let that take away from the fact that this is a great piece of science fiction. It has an unfading fascination. It's an immortal classic."
Treasure Island (AmazonClassics Edition),"Peg-legged pirates, colorful parrots, and plundered riches—they’re all here in Robert Louis Stevenson’s original seafaring adventure.
When young Jim Hawkins decides to follow a map to buried treasure, he must befriend or outsmart memorable characters such as pirate Long John Silver, captain Billy Bones, and island man Ben Gunn. Mutinous plans, mysterious deaths, and a tangle of double crosses keep Jim guessing all the way to the prize.
Inspired by real-life seafarers, Stevenson captures the adventurous spirit of the times and the imagination of readers, young and old alike.
Revised edition: Previously published as Treasure Island, this edition of Treasure Island (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Treasure Island, first published in book form in 1883, is THE pirate story. Many of the things we think of today as being trademarks of pirates (buried treasure, treasure maps, peg legs, parrots, desert islands) come more from Stevenson's tale than from history. But this book isn't about history, it's about pirates, adventure, and coming of age, and it delivers marvelously on all of those promises.

The narrator, young Jim Hawkins, lives and works at an inn owned by his parents. One day, a mysterious seaman takes lodging there with an equally mysterious chest. After some time, other sailors arrive looking for the first seaman. Out of this, from the seaman's chest Jim manages to find a treasure map leading to the untold riches of a now-dead but still famous pirate named Captain Flint. Jim takes the map to a couple of country gentlemen, who decide to charter a ship to look for the treasure and take Jim along as cabin boy.

Unfortunately for Jim and our heroes, but fortunately for the plot, they have a hard time finding sailors, and they turn to their new ship's cook, the one-legged Long John Silver, for ""help"" in rounding out the crew. Silver, as is hardly a spoiler, is actually a former pirate and crews the ship accordingly, having heard what they're after and eager to find those riches for himself.

The excitement mounts as Jim goes on several daring adventures to save himself and the faithful party, and Silver struggles to keep control of his mutineers, all the while treasure is calling. Jim shows a great deal of growth, taking charge of several perilous situations and demonstrating considerable bravery he never possessed when dealing with the mysterious sailor in his parents' inn. Silver, meanwhile, is a savvy character who's self-interest and ability to play both sides against the middle knows no bounds. If you're looking for a master of duplicity and double-cross, Silver could give Jack Sparrow lessons.

Stevenson's writing is fantastic. The colorful language of the pirates, and the refined speech of the gentlemen leading the faithful party, are a joy to experience. The drama steadily rises, despite the fact the book's story is well known and I've read it several times before. It's certainly no accident that this book has had such a powerful effect on an entire genre of fiction even 130 years later.

I've also listened to the book as narrated by Ralph Cosham, who I've enjoyed greatly and listened to on several other stories. If you're considering which audio version to listen to, you can't go wrong with Cosham's.

Treasure Island is about as easily available as a book can be, as every library will have it on hand, it's on Wikisource for free, Amazon has it for Kindle for free or in paperback for $2, and I've even seen it at Target for $1. It's also only 300 quick pages. Seriously, there is no excuse for not reading this book. I tried to read this about 60 years ago, as a fifth-grader. Gave up after a few chapters; the archaic terminology and sentence structure was impossible for a ten-year old.
I do remember the movie, which came out while I was still young, but know now that a lot was left out or substantially changed. A big difference between the dialogue in the book and the movie was the “talk like a pirate” silliness that is not to be found in the book.
Despite the difficult language, it is a good story. A must read for heroes and pirates alike. A great story that can be read in a couple of days. Although I'm not lacking for reading material I decided that it's important to read some of the 'classics' of literature to see how they stack up for the modern reader. Much of Robert Louis Stevenson's <em>Treasure Island</em> has become standard pirate lore in modern media. They way we think of a pirate - how they talk, what they sing (""Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum""), how they behave, maps with treasure marked by an 'X' - comes almost exclusively, still, from this book.

Young boy Jim Hawkins encounters a man, old Billy Bones, at the Admiral Benbow Inn in England. Billy Bones tells young Hawkins to keep an eye out for a one-legged scoundrel (Long John Silver). With that moment, Hawkins is pulled into a dangerous adventure.

Bones is attacked by former shipmates and dies (of a stroke) a short time later. The shipmates attack the lodge, but Hawkins and his mother have already taken the pirate's map from Bones' belongings and made their escape from the inn. Jim shares the map with some local respectable men, who decide to seek this treasure and take Jim on as a cabin boy.

On the island where the treasure should be buried, Jim encounters Ben Gunn, a former shipmate of the dreaded pirate who buried the treasure they now seek. Jim navigates the rough world of the pirate life while trying to remain a good, solid young man despite Silver's taking him under his wing. And when the treasure chest is found and the chest is empty, Jim, and Silver, face a mutinous crew ready to kill the leader and his protected boy.

So often we find literature from this era to be a bit dry and difficult to read due to our changes in reading habits and styles of writing, but this book holds up incredibly well. It moves along swiftly and is quite exciting to read. This can still be considered a page-turner as we can't wait to find out what happens next to Jim along his journey.

This is definitely highly recommended.

Looking for a good book? If you think you can't read that 'old stuff' because it's slow reading, then pick up this classic, <em>Treasure Island</em> by Robert Louis Stevenson, and be brought into an exciting adventure story.

Madame Bovary (AmazonClassics Edition),"Emma Bovary, daughter of an uneducated farmer and wife of a dull doctor in northern France, harbors a passion for everything beyond her grasp—sophistication, romance, love, and deliverance from her banal provincial life. Motivated by the primal, idealized, and vain, she seeks adventure. And with each new endeavor, Emma sets for herself an inevitable and inescapable trap.
Condemned as an affront to public morals, Madame Bovary’s obscenity trial made it notorious. Today, Emma stands as one of fiction’s most famous figures, and the novel itself, among the most pioneering and influential in world literature.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Madame Bovary, this edition of Madame Bovary (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Madame Bovary is one of those books we've all heard about but never get around to reading.
I recommend reading this book before watching any film production of this Flaubert accomplishment.
The story starts out by introducing Charles Bovary, who eventually marries Emma, the principal character of the book. Charles is by even 19th century standards , a nondescript regular guy. He is the village doctor, but not a particularly good one. Charles has one saving grace: he loves and adores his wife, the beautiful but irresponsible Emma. She plays the outward part of a good wife but inwardly seethes with contempt at the ineptitude and bumbling simplicity of her husband. Emma reads too many romance novels which causes her to regret that her husband does not measure up to any of her book heroes. From her novels she is convinced that a ""man surely , ought to know everything, ought to excel in a host of activities , ought to initiate you into the energies of passion, the refinements of life, all its mysteries. But this man knew nothing, taught nothing, desired nothing."" (pp39, Chap.7).
Emma has a string of affairs to assuage her personal unhappiness. She goes into debt in order to buy her lovers more and more expensive presents. In the meantime , she neglects her daughter and her husband. Marital life bores her to tears and the responsiblities of married life disgust her.
The story ends in a way we do not want.
Questions remain for the modern reader. It is as relevant today for women to ask themselves:
1) If our marriages are unhappy , do we just bail ? Have lovers? Pretend there is no problem?
2) Has society ceased to offer women support and encouragement for their very important roles
as wives and mothers?
Jackie Kennedy once said ,"" I'll be a wife and mother first, then First Lady."" She also said,""
If you bungle raising your children, I don't think whatever else you do matters very much.""
This book has a great introduction and analysis of the novel ,but I suggest reading it only after one has finished the book.
The themes of Emma Bovary are timeless and thought-provoking. This is not light reading. But it's well worth it to set aside some summer day for reading this unique portrayal of an unhappy wife in 19th century France and see its parallels in our modern world. Every writer's primary responsibility is to ensure his readers' time is made worthwhile. Flaubert's exceptional talent is description - strikingly, vivid, original descriptions of everyday events, people, surroundings that bring the reader into the moment. I've bookmarked each and every one I found in Madame Bovary because each is unparalleled in its exceptionality.

Recently I read an interview with James Joyce in which he complains he finds the narrative in Madame Bovary to be ""tedious."" No more so than that of most classics from previous eras in which the idioms, the prosody are awkward simply because they are not contemporary. (Of course, it's crucial you have a credible translation unless you are reading anything published in its original language.)

I decided to read Madame Bovary when I overheard a ""book club"" discussion indicting her for lascivious, promiscuous behavior. Instead what I found was an all too iconic tale of the loneliness of women, of this woman trapped in what so quickly became a loveless marriage. Whether the consequences are as tragic as what she endures is for each reader to decide, but there is no way to read this book and not reflect upon what men and women should do to preserve the vitality of their love. I bought this book solely for the purpose of reading it for a college class. As a result of this my personal investment in the actual narrative was weak from the start. I generally do not enjoy works about period piece romance and the complications of confusion in love and the affairs that nearly always result from them. Keep this in mind.

The form of the book itself is very comfortable to hold and look through, Its words are well sized and formatted to the page and it all fits in very well.

Flaubert is a skilled writer and knows very clearly how to present a narrative and need metaphors. However he suffers from i'd like the call the ""Tolkien syndrome."" Like J.R. Tolkien, Gustave likes to fly off the handle and nearly derail the story with excessive detail of settings. Now this again is my opinion, but it seems to me that a great deal of his forms of description do less for building the world of the story and more for a verbal flood of images, though they are well crafted, they appear ultimately useless.

The story itself is full of good details and characters and is all well and good. At the end of the day, i'd recommend this book for people who were either fans of the authors work or of the genre of romantic period pieces. A true classic full of flowery language and eccentric characters Hermoso, quedó perfecto para mi colección de clásicos. Vale mucho la pena. Madame Bovary é ótimo. Atemporal porque desde os primórdios da religião há os que professam conhecer a Deus, atribuindo-lhe regras e princípios que não saíram de sua boca e nem de sua vontade. Aliás, religiões e leis são criações humanas para limitar o homem às suas origens selvagens por pura incapacidade de fazê-lo melhor. É era justamente isso que Jesus combatia. A letra e os rituais exteriores. Geoffrey Hall does such a wonderful job of translating Flaubert's masterpiece into English while capturing the original nuances and emotion as expressed in the original French! Un horror y una obra maestra. Flaubert en realidad no era buena persona. Pero qué construcción."
The Sun Also Rises (AmazonClassics Edition),"In the aftermath of the First World War, Paris offers a liberating waystation for expatriate newspaperman Jake Barnes. Jake is a casualty of the war, and his disillusionment would be complete were it not for his relationship with the fast-living, twice-divorced Englishwoman Brett Ashley. Along with a small collection of other dissolute expats, Jake and Brett travel from the cafés of Paris to the wild fiestas of Pamplona on a desperate quest for fulfillment.
The Sun Also Rises paints a vivid portrait of a generation just beginning to grapple with the emotional and spiritual fallout of war, and it remains one of Ernest Hemingway’s most moving and captivating works.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Sun Also Rises, this edition of The Sun Also Rises (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. There is no point to reading Hemingway, particularly The Sun Also Rises, if you are looking merely for entertainment. The entire book is a denouncement of people who seek only entertainment and purposefully tries to exclude you from enjoying the book. Just don't read it if you read only for entertainment - you're already part of the Lost Generation, if that's what you're doing because, while you can deny it, that's you he is trying to capture in those dissolute spectators of the bullfight. They don't fight, they drink. In your case, reading is the same as drinking - a way to escape and be entertained. Hemingway and the proprietor of the bullfighter's hotel don't want you there. Go home. You're ruining it, he says.

Hemingway saw that people were not, as he had been taught as a child, becoming more and more capable of enjoying and producing peace and beauty. This was only true if you kept your head in the sand and tried to live in the suburbs. Hemingway's father had not yet shot himself, but his wife's father had - and he knew that, even in Midwestern America, the truth of life's very harsh realities could creep in. He adores the Spanish for maintaining a culture that permits the age old practice of tauromachia, bullfighting. It keeps people's heads on straight. It does not allow them to be ostriches. It is only natural that young Americans, raised to believe that the world is mostly entertainment and mostly constructed for their own enjoyment, would be drawn to a grittier cultural event - even if only briefly. The truly alive, though, become aficionados (in the Spanish sense) of the fights. They open their eyes to everything, particularly the specter of their own death.

Is it possible to enjoy contemplating death? One's own death? If you don't think it's possible, then this book is probably not for you. It is nothing like a horror story, it is not fake death made momentarily into an adrenalin rush, from which you can hide your face (you can hide your face while at the bullfights; you cannot hide from death itself).

Hemingway was born in 1899, just 4 years after certain historians had proclaimed the Closing of the American West (meaning: subduing of the last of the hunter-gatherer tribes and the complete expansion of ""traditional American values"" into the entire North American continent. He was raised with notions similar to what parents seem to want for their kids today, ideas about family life going well, everyone being happy, no drinking problems, no one acting out sexually, everyone gender-normal, and so on. Yet, he knew it wasn't so. He knew that humans are humans and there was nothing new under the sun.

Only men were sent into combat, young men with ideals in the case of World War I. Hemingway wants to capture the ""Riau Riau"" mindset that allows men, in a trancelike state, to rise up out of the trenches and charge forward while either being blown to bits or having other people's bits end up on your body (as happened to him). We are not going to live forever, are we? So why die as cowards? Die as a hero!

We don't push the heroism meme as much as it was pushed prior to World War I or World War II. We sort of gave up on that - perhaps in the 60's. Hemingway was part of the extinction of this kind of hero. Oh, people still invent games for themselves in which they travel, play sports, climb mountains, run marathons and so on, to still be ""heroes"" but without killing anything. We don't want heroism associated with killing or dying for a cause and yet, in all of human history, there it is still. People in Kiev (right or wrong) deciding to advance against the police and getting themselves shot - with others watching. People finding that even a shot to the leg isn't a good thing, and doesn't feel as heroic as it felt just a few minutes earlier, while preparing to advance on the enemy. People love having enemies, but the fact that for most 21st century American (and other Anglophone) readers, the ""enemies"" are now either things like evil corporations or the other people's rugby team, makes the world rather different.

In Hemingway's time, a huge war had just been fought, with people (much like oneself, by the way) as the real and true enemy. Germans had been part of the European community, just across the border from France, and now they were the enemy. Russia, once an ally, got itself a separate peace (and saved a bunch of Russians from being killed). Real people were killing real people with greater efficiency than ever before. But why?

Because people, men in particular, are designed this way. They get into groups, worked up into various frenzies, and stuff happens. Cultures that can channel the ""stuff"" into the bullring, well, perhaps that's a partial solution. Perhaps not (Hemingway will consider that in For Whom the Bell Tolls). Perhaps the bullring is merely a way of keeping people perpetually ready to rise up in violence and die for a cause. Maybe that's what all sports do (the ones that are true sports, Hemingway might say - he hated tennis).

If you are reading this book cold, you will probably have the reactions of many others (see the 3 star and lower reviews). I strongly suggest you read two volumes of Michael Reynolds's biography of Hemingway (the first two: Young Hemingway and the Paris Years). Read Paul Fussell's The Great War in Modern Memory before reading The Sun Also Rises. Don't just watch war movies, you will turn yourself into the very kind of reader that Hemingway is scathingly trying to insult.

Remember, Hemingway was trying to needle and agitate people who may be just like you or me, people who sit at home reading and have not been in the trenches, people who don't go to bullfights. How would he feel about modern audiences, with all the vegans and vegetarians and animal rights people within them? I think he would say that while the ambition is noble, that the understanding of the killing is more important than ever. If you are going to save animals (including people), you must understand human nature and human history. Human nature, on the ground, in all its somewhat eccentric and boring detail, must be at least noticed, and if possible, understood. Even changed.

When I first read The Sun, I deplored what I thought was the glorification of bullfighting and the cult of machismo. I was quite young and did not know much about the world then. I thought I would never read it again. When I read it the second time, I knew a lot more about Hemingway and I had read some of the 5 star reviews here. I realized I'd missed the whole point (and it isn't just about the symbolism - I got that part). Now, reading it again, slowly, a third time (because I am interested in understanding the craft of writing - so much is known about Hemingway's processes, reading it again with that information in mind is quite a new read), I realize that the intense literary criticism brought to bear on Hemingway, as well as his public persona, make this book completely amazing. It is a touchstone for not just one generation, but for almost a century's worth of modern readers. It changed how movies were made, it changed how people talked about reality.

Because once upon a time, people simply ignored the ""black sheep"" in every family, until they were piled up so high that someone had to notice that there were more black sheep than white sheep. The entire symbology of this black sheep/white sheep business had to be thrown over. Well brought up and well-to-do people were behaving outside of the standards of puritanical Christendom. Oh no. What to do? What to say? There were gay people! And women who liked sex! And people who had affairs! And prostitutes! And alcohol! (Even during prohibition!!!) Did the puritanical beliefs fail to take hold because the people were flawed? Or were the beliefs flawed? Or had anyone ever really believed them?

I think Hemingway leads us down many trails in answering these questions. He keeps his own cards close to his chest (he loved pictures of poker players and throwing dice; he spent money he didn't have on a painting of dice throwing by Masson). He knows that his parents seem to be ""true believers"" in the middle class, Midwestern ethos (he knows they will disapprove of the characters in the book, as so many readers here still do). He doesn't know, yet, that his father will shoot himself (and that two of his siblings will also be suicides). But he knows there's something amiss with the whole thing and in the end, prefers to slip back in time, and to another culture, to the corridas and the ancient dance with the bull. He knows that near Pamplona, some of the earliest art in the world depicts a human conception of a bull as powerful - but also the entire point of the Hunt. Even Hemingway, though, cannot make the actual bullfighter the protagonist of the novel, even if he intended him to be the Hero. Hemingway is too modern, himself, too much of a spectator to be a bullfighter - or, as he seems to say in The Sun, even a true aficionado.

Without true love for something, we are lost. The entire generation was lost, it had lost the possibility of true love. He thought he loved Hadley, during the period depicted in The Sun and in the period when he was writing it, he became painfully aware that he no longer loved Hadley in the same way - he had another ""true love."" He did not want to admit, ever, that he had lost the capability of loving truly, which is why he tried to capture the minutiae of how love is born and how it dies. By becoming expert on this subject of love (Lady Brett is certainly loved in many different ways, all of them ""true""), Hemingway hopes not to be lost.

Many of his other themes are lost on today's readers, though, because we have all but given up on the notions of masculinity and femininity that Hemingway was steeped in (as was the next generation after him, and the one after that - the ones who fought in World War II; they still had those same notions); we have given up on the touchstone of extreme competition as an inherent value (we give ribbons and trophies to all the kids who ""compete"" in our suburban children's leagues). Showing people drunk or otherwise intoxicated is a commonplace (Jersey Shores, anyone?) and no one is shocked - in fact, they are apparently amused and entertained. Perhaps that's why that aspect of the book seems relatively boring.

Finally, Hemingway doesn't want you to spectate. He purposefully took out interior monologues, bits about what people were thinking, many of the ""explanations"" of the action. He had this perverse idea that you, the reader, are supposed to be actively engaged - using your imagination. He was showing you exactly what happened. What did it mean? You are supposed to stop and think about it, imagine it. This book is a great one to read aloud with a significant other or older kids. We don't know a single family, anywhere, who doesn't have some of these people in them. In our neighborhood, there are drug addicts, 12 steppers, homeless people who apparently have wandered away from any sort of family - all kinds of ""lost"" people. Is your world really that different? If so, it will be changing soon. There is no where on the planet where a thinking person can live and not encounter the problems of death, destruction, unrequited loves and all that Hemingway scrupulously describes.

But it is a literary description, not a self-help book. He provides no answers and he didn't intend to be uplifting. This is one of the great books of the Twentieth Century, but the at times disappointing reading by Hurt causes me to deduct one star.

Hurt is too intrusive as a reader. He hams up the part of Michael Campbell with a thick and drunken Scottish accent. His reading makes a likeable character like Jake's buddy Bill seem like an oaf. His impression of Lady Ashley leaves one wondering why Jake or anyone else would even bother with her. Actors, of course, are supposed to interpret the work, but a lighter hand is necessary when reading a book as opposed to acting out a play. Moreover, Hurt's interpretation is unjustifiably negative. Yes, Hemingway is writing about the post-World-War-I ""Lost Generation"" and, yes, Jake hangs with a bunch of alcoholic wretches, but Hurt's interpretation is a bit too cartoon-like. There is more subtlety to these characters than Hurt is willing to acknowledge.

As for Hemingway's book, it's worth reading and re-reading. And this audiobook has allowed me to re-read the book easily at a later stage in life. In some ways the book does not age well. Robert Cohn is a central character, and the rank anti-semitism of the author as well as his characters is inexcusable. Cohn's ""Jewishness"" is totally gratuitous. Hemingway could have sketched this character without this cheap and mean-spirited use of the easy prejudices that so pervaded his time. Yes, we have to give Hemingway some slack and not judge him by modern standards; but not everyone was an anti-semite back then and a better man would have overcome this social prejudice.

On the other hand, the book is extraordinary for the muscularity of its prose. The story is told largely through dialogue and spare descriptions. It is a riveting style that draws the reader into the book and requires the reader to make many of the essential judgments about the various characters.

I can't agree with those reviewers who are left unmoved by the story. The story is quite interesting and fast moving. And it touches on the elemental themes of how to define a moral code in a lost world. Also striking is Hemingway's struggle with how to define masculinity in such a world. Jake seems to strike the best balance between assertiveness and empathy, but lacks the physical abilities. Cohn has the physical gifts but none of the emotional ones. The other characters seem to suffer from various self-destructive impulses, which seems to be a common outlet for the the masculine impulse. Perhaps the best masculine role model is the bullfighter, Romero, but there are hints that even he is prone to corruption and self-destructiveness.

I recommend the book, but see if there is an older, better reading somewhere. Why did I choose to read this book? I am a bullfighting “aficionado” (follower, enthusiast, fan, lover…what have you) and as such I always knew about Hemingway’s interaction with the “fiesta” during Pamplona’s celebrated San Fermín. I wanted to experience bullfighting in a literary context by the hand of one the greatest writers of the 20th century. But there was another reason…
Last year I met a rather enthusiastic group of Americans in Madrid’s bullfighting arena -Las Ventas- that was eager to experience first-hand and for the first time the intensity and poetic reality of the bullfighting ritual (corrida de toros, untranslatable as Hemingway explains in the book). At some point they began to flood me with questions about what was going on and what was all about -it is a rather complex, ritualised and structured event full of symbolism and many things going on the same time- and I discovered that I was quite resourceless when trying to explain a bullfight in English. I just couldn’t find the words and expressions. I actually had never even thought about bullfighting in English. I did what I could for the bull-tourists although I could tell from their odd faces that I wasn’t succeeding and what I was saying made little sense.
After this happened I finally decided to read the book as soon as I could to experience bullfighting as I never had before; in English.
I really enjoyed the read and Hemingway did a brilliant job –wasn’t surprised- putting to words the essence of bullfighting. Livro em ótimo estado e entregue no prazo. Tudo perfeito. Obrigado. I have some problems to find a cheaper edition of this masterpiece. This novel is art, life and passion.

The Invisible Man (AmazonClassics Edition),"Having devoted his studies to optics and refraction, an impulsive scientist named Griffin has rendered himself invisible. Unable to reverse the effects, his struggle to survive grows desperate until he realizes that there are benefits to living out of the public eye. Increasingly isolated, he soon spirals into a life of crime and degenerates into madness. He can’t see that he has become his own worst enemy.
Exploring the loss of identity and the willful disappearance of conscience and morality, H. G. Wells crafted one of his most suspenseful and cautionary tales, which continues to intrigue to this day.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Invisible Man, this edition of The Invisible Man (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Good literature never gets old and ""The Invisible Man"" is not the exception. Japanese invented emojis because internet communications, without gestures, are difficult to transmit the real feelings or motivations of our interlocutor. Each day we talk with armies of invisible men and women. Angels or monsters we don't know. This novel begins with the works of the invisible man in a small village, we don't know if he is in despair or hurt, but the vacuum behind his bandages, the nothing, is more horrible than mere tentacles or scars. I don't love this first part, I like it very much, but feels a bit slow, as if the invisible man (such a village name) would be trapped into a dull place. I loved the second part, when the invisible man now has a name, Griffin; when he tells his life in the city of London, as fantastic as him. We will not get to see his face, but his mind and heart are exposed in all their cruelty; the rejection of richness, almost its cursing, by the obsession of power and revenge. The end shows the usual care of Wells to develop secondary characters, an end i will not tell of course, as it is infinitely better told in the book.

The AmazonClassics edition as always, for English speaking authors, is the best edition of classic works already in the public domain. The formatting is clean and comfortable to read, the typography is modern, the X-Ray is an unobtrusive help for terms and characters, and, which I love so much, the text is pure as the day it was published, without busybody intellectuals to spoil the plot. Or pure as the year it was published, for some reason AmazonClassics always lack the year of first publication... and it is not an exception in ""The Invisible Man."" Beyond that minor detail the comfort to read Wells through the AmazonClassics Edition set it as a standard to measure other editions. *speaker steps up to podium to give review*

Good evening,
Invisible Man is one of those rare novels that have changed the shape of American literature. This nightmare journey across the racial divide tells unparalleled truths about the nature of bigotry and its effects on the minds of both victims and perpetrators. Readers are ushered into a parallel universe that throws our own into harsh and even hilarious relief. Suspenseful and sardonic, narrated in a voice that takes in the symphonic range of the American language, black and white, Invisible Man is one of the most audacious and dazzling novels of our century.

*intern runs up on stage and whispers*
*cocks head to the side and listens intently*
*whipering*.. ""Wells?.. Science Fiction?... ""THE!""

<em>still whispering.. ""You're telling me Invisible Man and THE Invisible Man are two different books?""... ""Which was this buddy read for?""... ""huh...""</em>
*intern slips away*

*Ahem*
Well then.

And that is <em>Invisible Man</em>. Quite an excellent book and you should all read it. But today we are here to talk about *THE*...Invisible Man by H. G. Wells. (apparently). The Invisible Man is a science fiction book about... my word... a man who is actually invisible! It is a classic tale of... hold on a minute.

*goes to read Anne's review*
*... hmm.. well that can't be right...*

So... uhm... what do you all say to a ten minute break? Great, great. Just.. go get a drink or something.

*returns shortly*

The Invisible Man is about a man trying to conduct some peaceful experiments in an inn in some hick town. The townsfolk constantly pepper him with questions like ""What's up with the bandages?"" and ""Why don't you take off your coat?"" and ""Would you like some cheese?"" The invisible man's typical reply is to sniffle at them.

*glances down below podium, flipping through pages*

Let's see... right, right...

After sniffling at the wrong person, the invisible man is eventually found out and chased out of town! At this point we start to see the invisible man for who he really is; an angry and violent man. He threatens a local man into helping him recover his belongings and *book slips and falls to ground* *audience eyes stage suspicously*

*snatches book from floor and opens to a random page*

Uh, yes, but that's not important. What is important is when *glances down at pages* he kills a cat! <em>wtf? he does what? well this guy is a right bastard</em>

Yes! This is where the reader begins to realize that the invisible man was not slowly driven mad due to his condition, but was crazypants to begin with! He finds an old associate and begins to tell the tale of how he became invisible, revealing that being invisible merely gave him an outlet for his dark desires. <em>huh, this is pretty good</em>

*reads*
(to self) oh, well that's interesting
*reads*
*audience starts to look at each other*
*reads*
(to self) oh, it's on now!
*audience slowly filters out of the room*
*reads* I've read the author's other books, but none were as interesting as this creation was. Go for it, if you're looking for a classic science-fiction story. I loved it! Da leggere in quanto capostipite del genere fantascientifico, il romanzo a mio giudizio offre diverse chiavi di lettura. Da una parte è una storia scritta per intrattenere e divertire il lettore (Wells mette in campo un'ironia a volte anche feroce) ma vi si può anche leggere un'analisi della condizione di alienazione dell'uomo moderno, di solitudine e di estraneità dell'essere umano rispetto ai propri simili e alla realtà che lo circonda. Lo compré por ser gratis pero aún no lo he leído. es para ebook, pero no creo que esté muy mal, con que me valga para pasar el rato me llega. Classique roman de science fiction, The Invisible Man est conforme aux principes que H.G. Wells met en œuvre dans ses récits; il introduit un élément fantastique dans une description sinon très réaliste de la société de son temps. Ici l'invisibilité de Griffin n'en fait pas un être aux pouvoirs surnaturels mais un génial chimiste qui une fois devenu invisible en explore les pouvoirs et les travers. Pour être invisible, il lui faut être nu et exposer un corps fragile aux dureté du climat et à la force brute des éléments. Pour être visible et participer à la société des hommes il doit prendre des précautions et se déguiser de la tête au pied pour ne pas laisser paraitre cette absence de corps visible. Il est alors tellement marginal, faisant figure de grand brûlé, qu'il est en butte à l'animosité presque instinctive des autres. Pris dans ce jeu entre le sentiment de puissance et la faiblesse de l'individu singulier, Griffin cherche une issue qu'il ne trouvera pas et sera soumis à l'ordre social de manière violente. L'invisibilité est un fardeau plus qu'un bienfait. I recently picked up a copy of ""The Invisible Man"" by H.G. Wells, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. This novel is an absolute masterpiece that has stood the test of time, and for good reason.

Wells's storytelling prowess is nothing short of phenomenal. From the very first page, I was drawn into the mysterious world of Griffin, the invisible man. The way Wells crafts the narrative and unravels Griffin's descent into madness is nothing short of brilliant. It's a gripping tale that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

The character development is remarkable, especially considering the challenges of portraying an invisible protagonist. Wells skillfully explores the psychological toll of invisibility on Griffin, and you can't help but feel sympathy for this complex and troubled character.

Moreover, the novel's exploration of the consequences of unchecked power and the isolation that comes with it is both thought-provoking and relevant even today. It's a story that delves deep into human nature and societal norms.

In addition to the compelling story, Wells's writing style is a delight to read. His descriptions are vivid, his dialogue is engaging, and he effortlessly transports you to the English countryside where the story unfolds.

""The Invisible Man"" is a literary gem that has left a lasting impact on science fiction and literature as a whole. Whether you're a fan of classic literature or just looking for a captivating and thought-provoking read, this book is an absolute must-read. I can't recommend it highly enough!"
Journey to the Center of the Earth (AmazonClassics Edition),"A sixteenth-century cryptogram spurs modern geologist Otto Liedenbrock to embark on the most remarkable human quest ever taken. With his nephew and guide, he leads the descent from a dormant Icelandic volcano into the unexplored realm beneath their feet. There, a vast subterranean ocean, prehistoric creatures, and natural phenomena are but a few of the wonders hidden from all but the boldest eyes.
Journey to the Center of the Earth epitomizes the subterranean fiction genre. Author Jules Verne leads readers deep below the world’s surface to the core of his inventive, visionary mind.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds. Jules Verne changed my life, and I suppose Jules Verne is the best French writer of his generation.
This story is really gripping and one you don't want to put down. I understand why so many movies, series, inventors and scientists has been inspired by Jules Verne.

The book has a lot of attention to real life details and that in addition makes the more fiction part if the book spark to life. Jules Verne had an exceptional knowledge mixed with fantasy that makes a great story. I now definitely wants to read the next books in the series.

I don't give it 5 star because it has a lot of scientific talk that can be a little bit much at time. I have an education in Science so I understood it all. But for people that don't have a deeper understanding of science will struggle with understanding some small parts of the book. I had heard of this book and have enjoyed reading it more than anything in recent years. What a wonderful adventure story! Gorgeous descriptions of the characters and the settings explored. A masterpiece! There are such interesting ideas in this book and such detailed explanations of science, which when considered make the other details so questionable. How could three men carry six months of food? How could their electric light last weeks on end? What energy source could power the light while still being light enough to carry? I also feel that Hans was such an unbelievable character. He was nearly a non-entity, and a humanoid robot would have been more believable. .I enjoyed the book, there were basic things that limited my ability to suspend disbelief. I was nervous at first because everyone says that Jules Verne can be a little boring or outdated, but I really enjoyed this adventure!! Do wish more fun things could have happened in the core area but I really liked reading a book mostly about people walking in the dark. The ending was decently satisfying too. I’ll admit I had concerns about it wrapping up, but it played out really well! Looking forward to 20,000 leagues next! This book about a Professor of Anthropology, his nephew, and an Icelandic Hunter was a complex read. I mean that terms specific to the science spoken about are used: Anthropology, archaeology, terms about the strata of rock formations, and the terms used by scientists to describe the ages of humankind were used frequently, and I was so happy to have the embedded Kindle dictionary handy. Accuracy was certainly key to describing this journey, and the research behind this book was extensive. The few chapters that I was able to read about the expedition without a dictionary were suspenseful and action packed. I definitely felt as if I could see, hear, and feel the dangers experienced by the travelers, and I felt their relief at each leg of the journey. What a fantastic journey! I have read this aloud twice to two different children and while a workout for the mouth- but what wonderful words and facts -love all his books and especially the series which includes the castaways etc(read in order though, so incredibly interwoven) Enjoyed every chapter thoroughly, an exciting journey indeed.
Would recommend to others interested in science fiction stories. Will explore his other works. Un buon testo classico utile anche per rafforzare il proprio inglese.
Ho notato che i testi classici, come questo, di autori non inglesi tradotti successivamente in inglese, sono molto utili per esercitarsi nella lettura (reading).
Testo consigliato. Enjoyable great book Ah, the joy of reading literature in an almost perfect translation! This, augmented by an equally inspired narration (if you purchased its Audible companion) will delight your soul.
Jules Verne remains atemporal; with the same joy he is read presently as he was 100 years ago, equally by the youth and the grown-up. Great read."
Beyond Good and Evil (AmazonClassics Edition),"A caustic criticism of nearly every philosophic predecessor and a challenge of traditionally held views on right and wrong, Friedrich Nietzsche’s Beyond Good and Evil paved the way for modern philosophical thought. Through nearly three hundred transformative aphorisms, Nietzsche presents a worldview in which neither truth nor morality are absolutes, and where good and evil are not opposites but counterparts that stem from the same desires.
Beyond Good and Evil was a foundational text for early twentieth-century thinkers, including philosophers, psychologists, novelists, and playwrights. Today’s readers will delight in Nietzsche’s pithy wit and irony while gaining a deeper understanding of his core ideology.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from iconic authors. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or revisit an old favorite, these new editions open the door to the stories and ideas that have shaped our world.
Revised edition: Previously published as Beyond Good and Evil, this edition of Beyond Good and Evil (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Great book obviously but the print is absolutely tiny so if you have trouble with reading tiny print or even if you don’t think you do, you will with this edition. This is one of the foundations that anyone interested in Philosophy will read at some point. Nietzshe is one of the key authors in this area and will form the core of most discussions in morality.

This said, while thought provoking, insightful and intriguing, unless you are looking to get into a philosophical debate on morality or looking for thoughts to guide political decisions, this isn't your book. If you want a fast read, entertainment or something that keeps you awake, this isn't your book. Caution needed as this may cause: headaches as you try to grasp the larger concepts and loss of consciousness as you fall asleep after just a few pages.

I enjoyed this book. I'll be keeping it on my Kindle and have highlights/notes to go back to. But even I had to focus to push through all of this book. I didn’t expect this. It turned out to be a treasure trove of quotes and made some really good critiques of philosophy and philosophers and made me think of how silly and self absorbed they are (were) . When I listen to academics and political philosophers today I hear the same idiocy that nietzche wrote about. I listened to the book on audible. It was good, but I think I would enjoy the text more. Anyway, it’s not the type of book to read need to end in one sitting . It needs to be read slowly and thoughtfully I’m smarter now. You can’t just read this– you need to study it. It’s made my conversations so much better. First let me say some of the book was like being on an acid trip, pondering ideas, coming from nowhere and ending incomplete. Maybe I didn't understand the relativity of tearing down philosophies of religion and artists. But I did like the final chapter, once I understood the that ideas where randomly going to be asserted and not supported, and to be taken on the authority of him. Saying that there were alot of insightful things. But let me also say that it is strange that many places in the book it is stating to form your own ideas your own ethics your own humanity and why because I say so, wow how thought provoking is that. Maybe it is because I believe in freedom I don't understand forcing or being forced. What does one care what another does or does not in his religion or philosophy right or wrong it is order for them. Example he makes reference to flat earth being it is self evident, well he was wrong, so should we dismiss the book, does that mean there is no master and slave. There is plenty I agree on and would surely have back up with reason and created arguments rather the assert the because I am smarter argument, which is difficult to do when you are saying create your own world. So my question is it enlighten or psychopathic is it genius or crazy.
Are Germans better than English. Be self reliant and we could be if it were for those people. If you like my review, you will like the book, jumping all over the place asserting ideas without reasoning but good information within. Maybe being nonreligious I don't get the push back. Not being German seeing how one composer is better than another because of race. Hmm! I guess we will take it on his authority. So in conclusions a mess of good and bad ideas in random order to go though like stacks of papers on a desk this pile over here for this, this one over there for that. Still feel a great philosopher, ideas and concept are great more than that extraordinary I do use them. If you have not read this I must ask why. Then I must ask you to ask yourself why. Anything by Nietzche is not just interesting and a learning experience, it is hillarious as well. despite the label of being a nihlist, given by people who never read him or disagree with him, Nietzche has a profound insight to life that is actually quite joyous-not just in this work but in general. I suggest every book he has, mind you I am biased as I was a philosophy major and had to read him anyway, bvut I had read him befor that too. It's worth it to buy this alone or better yet buy a collected works that includes his other work as well. Great book but it's a difficult read fot a novice like me You can get Nietzsche's masterpiece for $3.99. The book is made with pretty low quality however, it is light and easy to carry. The content is great! ok. Zuerst--es ist möglich dass ich nicht über dieses Buch schreiben. Warum? Ich habe nur zwölf Prozent gelesen. Aber es freut mich so sehr dass ich muss. Ich lese auf Englisch und nicht auf Deutsch. Trotzdem habe ich nicht so viel gelacht seit ich PG Wodehouse gelesen habe.
Nietzsche hat kein Respekt für alle andere Philosophen. Er spricht (mehr oder weniger) in Klartext. Ich habe viele Philosophie gelesen und schrieben--mein zweites Buch--""The Philosophy of Common Sense"" ist auf Kindle. Ich habe Heidegger gelesen als ich fünfzehn war... lese und lache.... Hızlı geldi. Her şey yolundaydı. Fiyat çok makul Bem impresso com letra suficientemente grande para ser lido com facilidade no formato «paper back». Nietzsche at his best. Absolutely recommend. Buen libro y llegó en buen estado."
Mansfield Park (AmazonClassics Edition),"After her impoverished family sends her to live with her wealthy aunt and uncle at opulent Mansfield Park, Fanny Price finds her life forever changed by the aristocratic Bertrams and the city-dwelling Crawford siblings. But is it for the better? While the others seem content to abandon what’s right to further their own interests, Fanny decides to hold true to her heart—a choice that will make or break her future.

Book Thoughts:
Most people would turn their heads and stare to know that I love this second when I rank the six Jane Austen novels. I felt an urge to pick up this well-narrated audio version and listen in once again. I will share a ramble of thoughts on what jumped out at me this go around rather than a well-constructed review.

As a teen, I think I related to Fanny's shyness, awkwardness, and I knew an underdog when I saw one. None of those early reactions of changed. Oh, granted, I've noticed her youthful immaturity come into play with her jealous condemnation or quick repudiation of some of those around her without the softer way an adult can hold to conviction with compassion and understanding (note I say 'can' because even as adults, we are quick to pounce on other people's mistakes or missteps at times).

It's easy to forget Fanny is but eighteen here and she is the youngest of all the principal characters. She possesses a poise and gravity that her fickle, vain female cousins and even her aunts do not. Mary Crawford is the only of the female characters who can come close to rivaling her in intellect when she makes an effort while at Mansfield, but once back in the bosom of her shallow London friends, she shelves her brains to conform (and no, I'm not grudging people some frivolity and entertainment now and then) that it's okay to detest one's spouse and the only serious consideration when choosing said spouse is advancement or money. One can gripe to their friends about their misery and have their fun afterward even if it means sporting with or shattering another marriage.

And, that sporting with other people's affections and lives is what struck me so hard this time about Henry Crawford and Mrs. Norris. Gasp, I know. I put two such people in the same sentence. He's rakish and she's parsimonious so they don't appear to have a lot in common. But, in their own ways, they share a liking for twisting people to do their will and take pleasure in it.

And, that segues me nicely into why I appreciate this one. Austen is both poking fun at the all too serious folks with conviction while also giving them the grave nod that one should have discernment. The movie adaptions make most of the characters shine so they appeal while the book paints them all with a darker shade so their unappealing sides are more visible. Mary Crawford's character is where I see that most and, I do not blame the filmmakers for this choice. Someone has to be likeable, right? We wink with her over her flaws, but the book presents her with more mercenary designs that Fanny sees because her partiality shields her from the dazzle and attraction of the Crawfords. And, to give due credit, Fanny's educated and thought-filled mind help her parse out what her Bertram cousins can't and won't see particularly in Henry Crawford.

Wanda McCaddon did well with the range of voices from old to young, gender, class, and personality so that I had no trouble delving into the story each time I clicked it on.

The fact is I enjoy this book because I see it as part cautionary tale, part entertainment as Austen rolls out so many disparaging characters and brings them together at MP, but also part subtle complexity in that things are not only one faceted from the characters to the plot. Timid Fanny doesn't sparkle or have great appeal, but she has an inner strength that stands pat when she hits a pivotal moment of decision with everything and everyone ranged against her. When Mansfield Park first appeared in print in 1814, it was thought of as the least romantic novel by Jane Austen.

In the story, as the result of her aunt Norris’s guiles, Fanny Prices comes to live with her Aunt Lady Bertram and Uncle Sir Thomas Bertram at Mansfield Park at a young age. Fanny Price’s own family has nine children and the father is an old sailor who drinks, as Fanny’s mother, unlike her two sisters Lady Bertram and Aunt Norris, has married beneath her.

The Bertrams have four children--two boys, Tom and Edmund and two girls, Maria and Julia. Of all the four children Edmund is the one who befriends and helps Fanny. Although Fanny’s situation in Mansfield Park is much better than what it would have been in the home that she was born, she is nevertheless beneath the family’s own children and often is the receiver of Aunt Norris’s contempt.

Still, Fanny becomes an indispensable companion to Aunt Bertram, and although she is shy and deferential, she is better accepted once all the children reach young adult status. At this time, both Maria and Julia have come out (as debutantes) in the society, but nobody has thought of Fanny, and Fanny has never been to a ball. Edmund still is a best friend to Fanny and is becoming ready to be ordained.

In the meantime, Sir Thomas leaves for Antigua to take care of his plantations. About the same time, the Crawford siblings Henry and Mary arrive in the neighborhood, Henry begins flirting with Maria, who falls for him, and Edmund goes after Mary while Fanny has secretly fallen in love with Edmund. Then all the young people get involved in the production of the play.

Up to here in the story, I had to force myself to read on because the social class distinctions and the fake politeness of speech and manner got to me, which I am sure, an author of Austen’s caliber correctly portrayed the English society of early nineteenth century. With the production of the play and the events that followed it, the story finally captured me and I read it to its end.

As to its end, nearly everyone gets married and is not all that happy, except for Edmund and Fanny. Although I am not all that much in favor of first cousins marrying, it has been done in most societies and the twists and turns just before that have made the reading of this novel quite interesting.

The writing style of the author is insightful not only where the characters are concerned but also with the social structure, scenery and settings, and civility and ethics requirements of the times. One thing that separates Austen’s style from that of today’s understanding of style is that author information as to Austen’s judgment is inserted quite often and especially during denouement; however, the writing is detailed and empathetic specifically where Fanny is concerned. Also, the author begins by showing a setting or an event, and then she zeroes into the characters. As such, most of the internal story is told by the author and not shown by the dialogue or other tools of fiction.

Characterization is exquisite with most of the primary characters’ behaviors differing from one another.

The ending is told not shown and it ends abruptly with the author saying, she is purposely not showing the details of events or the realization of the change in Edmund. “ I purposely abstain from dates on this occasion, that every one may be at liberty to fix their own, aware that the cure of unconquerable passions, and the transfer of unchanging attachments, must vary much as to time in different people. I only entreat everybody to believe that exactly at the time when it was quite natural that it should be so, and not a week earlier, Edmund did cease to care about Miss Crawford, and became as anxious to marry Fanny as Fanny herself could desire.”

Unlike most readers who love Victorian or Georgian Romance Novels, I had always stayed away from them because of what I deemed as pretentiousness that turned me off. After reading Mansfield Park, however, I am getting warmed up to reading another such novel. Reviews call this the darkest of Austen's novels. It has a psychological dept that her other books, lighter and more satyrical, lack. A good insight on trauma, love and honor. ジュリエット・スティーブンソンによる『マンスフィールド・パーク』の

ジュリエット・スティーブンソンの朗読はとても聞きやすいので、オススメします。 Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's third novel, regarded by most critics as her most mature and complex work. However, given the unpopularity surrounding the novel, it is easy to relegate this work to the margins in favour of her other, more celebrated works. The one puzzling aspect of this is what exactly contributes to the widespread apathy towards this work. Lionel Trilling, the celebrated Austen critic and scholar, once famously wrote of Mansfield: ""For those who admire her it is likely to make an occasion of embarrassment. By the same token it is the novel which the depreciators of Jane Austen may cite most tellingly in justification of their antagonism.""

In popular discourse, Austen figures as the creator of fiery, intelligent women who deliver scathingly witty repartees and refuse to bow down to societal norms and pressures of what a 'good girl' is supposed to do. Austen is seen, and not incorrectly, as the subverter and critique of the stifling expectations laid down on Victorian women, as exemplified through women like Lizzie Bennet, Emma Woodhouse and Elinor Dashwood. When you keep that in mind while reading Mansfield Park, the character of Fanny Price feels almost like a betrayal: here is a girl who is poor, lacking in health, vitality and beauty, and apparently seems to have none of that feistiness or pizzazz that her literary predecessors had. Rightly so. Fanny Price comes across meek, timid, submissive, and seems to uphold rigid ideas of feminine virtues (recall especially the episode of the private theatricals, where she is shocked by the fact that her cousins are enacting women blatantly lacking in modesty).

However, as a literature student, it falls to my happy lot to scratch below the surface. Fanny, by virtue of her modesty and meekness, becomes the moral compass of the novel, quietly but insistently guiding the characters at Mansfield. She is also the perfect embodiment of what Locke calls the 'modern self', able to choose wisely for herself and possessing the discerning ability to pick long-term happiness over short-term gratification, unlike her Bertram cousins.

Mansfield Park is a complex, multilayered work which, initially can come across as boring and tedious. However, it is in this novel that Austen's true literary genius shines.

The Penguin Edition, annotated with an introduction by Kathryn Sutherland, is as wonderful as one could expect Penguin to be. The book was delivered promptly in one day. wonderful read. I love the characters. Jane has turned ordinary people into snarks, louts, borderlines, and a few quite lovely people. Poor Fanny who looks so frail but appears to be so strong in the end.
The most romantic story by Jane Austen"
The Brothers Karamazov (AmazonClassics Edition),"The Karamazov brothers are as different as mind, body, and spirit. Ivan, an atheist and brooding intellectual; Dmitri, a volatile sensualist and his father’s rival for the beautiful Grushenka; and Alexey, driven by unshakeable piety. In their shadow is their rejected half-brother, humiliated into servitude. Together they act to rid themselves of the dissolute Karamazov patriarch. Then, in a single shocking act, the fates of the brothers are inexorably altered.
Delving into debates about God, free will, faith, doubt, and moral responsibility, The Brothers Karamazov is Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s profound pioneering masterpiece of psychological realism.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Brothers Karamazov, this edition of The Brothers Karamazov (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. One hardly needs to praise this acclaimed novel. But after my third reading I am in awe. The novel works in two entirely different ways, which are nevertheless intertwined. On one hand it is a great story. On the other hand it is a profound meditation. (Interestingly I recently watched two film versions -- the American/Hollywood (1958) and the Russian (1969) -- that divide on just this point. Both are excellent movies, I feel, but the American one works strictly as a great romance and crime drama, while the Russian one is truer to the philosophical concerns.)

The reason Dostoevsky had for writing this novel, besides his continual need to support himself and his family, and his passion for writing, was to convey the idea that (what he considered) the innate faith of the Russian people in God, immortality, and Christ is essential to living morally. (In “real life” Dostoevsky was fanatical about this, to the point of viewing Russian Orthodoxy – the tsar included -- as key to the salvation of the whole world. He might very well have been a Putin supporter, despite his otherwise agapic and socialist leanings.)

This idea is embodied by Alyosha Karamazov, one of the brothers and a Christ-like figure of universal loving, and also his spiritual mentor, Father Zosima. The idea is also embodied in the brother Ivan (and his own acolyte, the brother Smerdyakov), albeit in its negative manifestation, since he accepts the implication – that without God, everything is permissible, including crime – but, opposite to Alyosha, rejects God.

The fourth brother, Dmitri, embodies the idea as well, but in his case – perhaps the most typically human -- God “wins” but always with a struggle. With Alyosha godliness is simply natural. Ivan also struggles, but in him God’s victory is only intermittent because Ivan’s reason and compassion find the evil in the world to be in absolute conflict with the conception of a good and all-powerful God. (Smerdyakov is the extreme God-rejector, Alyosha’s pure opposite.) Thus faith alone (and even contrary to reason), as Alyosha possesses with passion (but also Dmitri, if only by Russian instinct), could give God a clear victory.
Dostoevsky does not shy away from this implication. That is one thing that makes this novel great: It challenges the believer so effectively that many readers will side with Ivan’s impassioned argument for atheism. And also for this reason, the story (and character) aspect of the novel is crucial; indeed, Dostoevsky believed that it was the answer to Ivan’s argument, which otherwise could not be defeated by rational argument.

The reader will have to judge how successfully the events and characters of the novel refute atheism. I myself think that Dostoevsky’s position doesn’t make sense even in its own terms. Consider that for everything to be “permitted,” there would still need to be an authority that permits; but if God does not exist, who would there be to permit anything? So crime would not be permitted, no more than it would be prohibited if there were no God (according to the theodic logic).

Be that as it may, the story and characters stand on their own merits, it seems to me. And here again the novel is a great one. As an aspiring novelist myself, I am in awe of the many amazing personalities and ingenious intricacies of plot that Dostoevsky introduces in this mammoth book. How he was able to maintain the cohesion despite facing publishing deadlines for installments, usual for his day, is beyond my comprehension. (He failed to do this in previous novels. This one was his greatest and final triumph. He died shortly after completion … with a second volume tantalizingly forming in his mind.) Great novel from a great author exploring and explaining the complexities of the human condition. The insights Dostoevsky had back then are as relevant if not more so now. What the hell kind of ending was that?!

Dostoyevsky, I love you, I really do...and I loved The Brothers Karamazov; but the ending, the ending...how depressing.

I expected so much more. The story was interesting; yes, it was long winded at times, but it was very interesting. I thought I would read about Mitya's escape from prison. Or, read about how he was actually guilty...or actually not guilty. Instead, I read about a poor elementary school boys passing.

Dostoyevsky. I understand that this was your last novel. Your ""swan song"" so to speak, and i understand that you were facing your mortality so the novel was very philisophilical, but to end it like that. With PANCAKES! PANCAKES, DOSTOYEVSKY! PANCAKES!

My dear, Dostoyevsky. I do not want to break up with you over an ending of a book. I implore you, if I ever meet you in the heavens, to tell me if Mitya was actually the murderer of his father or not. But, I guess, that is what you want. To leave your readers hanging by a thread FOREVER. What power you must have. How you must be laughing at all of us!

Just you wait! I will seek you out in the heavens and ask you all my questions. You are not free! This is one of my favorite books. I prize it primarily because of the characters Alyosha and Father Zossima, both of whom are profoundly good. It is very difficult to write about good people. As another famous Russian novelist famously pointed out, it is the bad characters and families that have the interesting lives. This book is made interesting by the introduction of numerous villains who engage and entice the reader, and who confuse and torment the good Alyosha.

The most famous passage in the book, and indeed one of the most famous in all literature, is called The Grand Inquisitor. It is important to note, however, that that portrait of evil is a fiction created by one of the characters in the book. Alyosha and Zossima, on the other hand, are ""real"" characters -- at least within the framework of the book. We are perhaps not meant to trust the narrative in the Grand Inquisitor, while we are meant to trust Zossima and Alyosha.

This book is important because of the wisdom of its author. Dostoevsky perhaps never mastered the art of living a good life, but he did master the art of portraying goodness and evil in fiction. For most of my life Zossima and Alyosha have stood in my mind (either consciously or unconsciously) as beacons of light in a dark world, and the other characters, to varying degrees, have represented the numerous temptations and missteps that plague most of our lives. As such, the book is not so much a novel, as a spiritual guide.

Dostoevsky was one of the first authors to deeply understand the modern mind, and I'm not at all sure that anything written since the appearance of this book has fully supplanted it portrayal of the pitfalls of passion, materialism and pride. A good deal of suffering could be avoided if more people could understand how acts of spiritual discipline can help us realize the simple message of love and compassion found in this book. Brothers Karamazov is a huge challenge if you don't have a good grasp of the language. This version makes it possible to get a lot more from the work than you would simply by reading it in English.
There are quite a few slips. Also, it can be hard to keep track of who is speaking in conversations, because of the differing punctuation systems between the two languages. Having said that, I got to the end, on the strength of evening class Russian and a fair bit of general reading after that.
The sort of thing that gets lost in translation is the distinction between ты and вы, which is especially important in the section where different classes of visitors consult Zosima for spiritual advice. A true bargain for this masterpiece. Brand new book delivered in a couple of days, I warmly recommend the seller! Awesome book. Go for it. Me encantó la historia. Los rusos tienen otra forma de escribir Unbeatable price, a masterpiece of lirerature & story telling"
Northanger Abbey (AmazonClassics Edition),"Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland excitedly accepts an offer to accompany family friends on a trip to Bath. There, Catherine makes new acquaintances who invite her to Northanger Abbey, and she encounters a world she’d only glimpsed in the pages of her beloved gothic novels. Through Catherine’s eyes, the Abbey is full of mystery, suspense, and adventure; and she is the heroine at the center of it all. As her imagination begins to run wild, she imperils her summer, her new friendships, and her burgeoning relationship with the charming Henry Tilney.
Both a satire of gothic fiction and a coming-of-age story, Northanger Abbey is widely regarded as one of Jane Austen’s most comedic works.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Northanger Abbey, this edition of Northanger Abbey (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I have spent the last few days re-reading uncharacteristically slowly. This Jane Austen classic is worth savoring. There are so many passages that display the author's sly observational wit and brilliance. And the illustrations add a little something extra in this kindle edition.

I love the way she creates her characters through their dialogue. John Thorpe is a recognizable example. How many ladies HAVEN'T been out with a guy who's such a gearhead that he doesn't realize that perhaps his date isn't interested in the differences between a Mustang and a Corvette? The same guy who brags and embellishes his supposed accomplishments? And is certain he knows what's best for you and makes decisions for you without really listening to you? Yeah, THAT guy. I hate that guy. Jane Austen describes him to a ""T"" (although, in John's case, it's actual horses rather than horsepower that he's obsessed with).

And then there's his sister, Isabella Thorpe. Have you ever known somebody who gushes and fawns all over you as though she's your bestest friend in the whole entire world, but she turns out to be just using you? Who pretends not to notice guys but makes sure that she's in the most prominent spot so they can't help but notice her? Who knows how to make them fall at her feet even though she's a flat-out phony? Yeah, THAT ""friend."" Ms. Austen's got that type pegged here, too. I'm really glad Isabella gets hoisted by her own petard so James Morland doesn't get stuck married to that nasty piece of muslin.

Then there's Mrs. Allen's ridiculous preoccupation with clothing. I could go on with numerous other examples, but you get the idea.

This is primarily a coming of age story about one Catherine Morland. She is a sweet, plain-spoken, naive 18-year-old young lady who goes to Bath with the Allens, a respectable older couple. She doesn't recognize hyperbole and is extremely gullible. At the Pump Room, she makes the acquaintance of the aforementioned Isabella whose brother John, as it happens, is good friends with James, Catherine's brother. Catherine also makes the acquaintance of Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor, who are much pleasanter company than the Thorpe siblings. (If you're unsure why, see descriptions of the Thorpe characters above.) As the story goes on, she also meets Captain Tilney, Henry and Eleanor's older brother, and General Tilney, their father. The book title is taken from the name of General Tilney's residence in Gloucestershire, where Catherine has a very confusing and eventful visit. By the book's end, she is older and wiser when it comes to recognizing duplicitous people.

A chunk of this book pokes gentle fun at scary gothic novels. Just a few months ago, I read a piece of Austen's juvenalia, Love and Friendship (NOT the recent movie, but the book!!), which takes a more frontal approach to mocking such tales. Reading Northanger Abbey so soon afterward, I can recognize her improved writing skills and more sophisticated story-telling. In this book, Catherine is an enthusiastic devotee of The Mysteries of Udolpho and the like, and she's thrilled to be visiting an actual abbey. When she first arrives, she's severely disappointed because there's nothing sinister about it at all. But once nighttime and a raging storm hits, she's a bundle of nerves and imagining all kinds of nonsense. I don't read a lot of scary books, but I'll never forget how nervous I felt alone in my house the night I was wading through one of Stephen King's novels!

And that's the reason we're still talking about Jane Austen's books today and will continue talking about them for many eons to come. Her characters are people we recognize; they're relatable and feel real. The situations are credible. There may be more coincidences than we encounter in real life, but they serve to keep her plots compact and interesting. Every time I read this (or any of JA's other masterpieces), I find more to admire and marvel at. Jane Austen wrote ""Northanger Abbey"" in the late 1790's, but it was not finally published until 1818, after her death. It is a broad satire of the Gothic Romance novels popular in her day. Its lead character, the innocent young Catherine Morland, is moderately attractive, good-hearted, and highly imaginative, but perhaps the least compelling of Austen's heroines. Nevertheless, Jane Austen's excellent writing gifts are on display in this short novel, which offers some superbly funny dialogue, witty commentary on social manners, and a sympathetic heroine.

Catherine is offered the opportunity to vacation in the resort town of Bath by family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen. In Bath, she falls in with two people her own age, Isabella and John Thorpe. Isabella is to be engaged to Catherine's brother James, while John, a college friend of James, takes an interest in Catherine. The Thorpes involve the inexperienced Catherine in the social whirl of Bath. They will also provide her with some hard lessons in manners.

Catherine also meets Henry and Elinor Tilney, a brother and sister who introduce her to walks and intellectual discussion. Their father, the imposing General Tilney, invites Catherine to visit the family estate of Northanger Abbey. Catherine eagerly accepts the invitation, in part to stay close to Henry, on whom she has a crush, and in part to see the ancient abbey, sure to be the embodiment of her cherished Gothic Romances.

Catherine's willingness to see dark secrets in ordinary events leads her on a search of the Abbey for clues to the suspected murder of General Tilney's wife. In a gentle confrontation, Henry ends the search, but is not able to save her from the sudden wrath of the General, who banishes her from the Abbey. A heartbroken Catherine is separated from Henry and Catherine, and returned unceremoniously to her home. There, an unexpected visit by Henry Tilney will offer an explanation for what happened at Northanger Abbey and a chance to reunite with the Tilneys.

Readers expecting a story with the heft of ""Pride and Prejudice"" or ""Mansfield Park"" may be disappointed. However, ""Northanger Abbey"" is a fun book on its own terms, very much a Jane Austen product and likely to be enjoyed by her fans. It is highly recommended as an entertaining read. On my second reading/listen to Northanger Abbey, I gained more insight into conversations and characters. One character of whom I became more aware was Isobel and her extreme manipulation. We cannot definitely know if the behaviors are done consciously, or if she interacts with others so in such a way by default, lacking any personal insight. I suspect it is the former, though perhaps some of both. Henry demonstrates a strong sense of humor, but also wisdom and mercy.
I thought the narrator did a very good job. I can’t agree with a previous reviewer’s low rating. She is not one of the best, but very good, and I think she can become better. I think she was especially strong in portraying the needling voice of Isobel Thorpe (ugh!). There are some narrators I cannot listen to (e.g., they read with same emphasis and volume, even though text states character is angry or upset), though they seem to be popular with others Audible customers.
Note: The book version sold with the audio does not have a full table of contents, and the end of Chapter 14 is missing, both of which are frustrating. Also, they are not synced together, which I did not realize initially. If purchasing the book only to read, choose another version. It would be great if someone at Kindle could address these issues.
Ms. Austen’s brilliance shines through all other imperfections. I purchased the Vintage Classics Austen Series edition of Northanger Abbey, and I’m absolutely delighted with it! The book arrived in perfect condition—no dents, creases, or defects. The cover design is stunning, with a classic yet modern aesthetic that makes it a great addition to my collection.

The print quality is excellent, with clear and well-spaced text, making for a comfortable reading experience. The paper feels high-quality, and the overall binding is sturdy.

As for the content, Northanger Abbey is a witty and satirical take on gothic novels, featuring Jane Austen’s signature humor and social commentary. It’s a delightful read, especially for Austen fans.

Highly recommend this edition for both its beauty and readability! Meu primeiro livre da chiltern. Comprarei outros! A qualidade é incrível. Livro costurado(não é colado), lateral prateada, paginas brilhosas (nao dá pra anotar, mas isso não é um problema pra mim). O tamanho é de uma palma. Eu li em algum lugar que a editora teve a intenção de manter o tamanho original da primeira edição de orgulho e preconceito.
Tem uma fitinha pra marcar a pagina tb. Recomendo demais! Vejam os outros livros da chiltern. Lindos! I read this book as a related text for my extension 1 english module: Romanticism. Filled with gothic conventions and the three components of romanticism; idealism, individualism and imagination, it took me on an incredible journey to when love was real and the imagination soared without the limitations of modern societal culture. It is certainly worth the read. There can be no opinion given but the best for Austin. A descriptive must for Classic readers. A book that can be read over again. BELLO!!!"
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (AmazonClassics Edition),"Whether he’s sneaking doughnuts, mooning over a pretty girl, or snookering the local boys to do his work for him, Tom Sawyer is the consummate schemer—but his charm and easygoing nature keep him from being in anyone’s bad graces for long. However, when Tom teams up with his friend Huck Finn, their sleepy Missouri town had better watch out.
Based on Mark Twain’s memories of growing up along the Mississippi River, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is both an idyllic picture of boyhood and an affectionate satire of adult conventions.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, this edition of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This review applies specifically to the April 2010, Sterling Edition, illustrated by Robert Ingpen:
I'm beginning to feel quite frustrated with the limited publishing information given to books on Amazon. For example, most books where you may click to ""look inside"" will default to the most common paperback. For books like Tom Sawyer, that is fine if you need the book for high school English class, where any copy cheap enough to write notes in the margins will do. I wanted a copy of Tom Sawyer to keep and love. I saw this publication on Amazon, but it had so little info and the one review given was a single sentence about the general value of Twain's story. The truth is, one doesn't buy this particular printing unless one is already convinced of it's literary excellency! So I am about to do Amazon a huge favor by telling you what it didn't tell me. For about $15, the asking price at the time of this review, you can invest in a real treat for your self or someone you love and wish to inspire.
This printing was meant to mark the one hundredth anniversary of Twain's death (2010). The story is unabridged, provided in full original text. It is positively rich with watercolor illustrations by Robert Ingpen. I just skimmed through the book looking for one that I especially liked, but I couldn't pick just one. In design, they are exactly as I would have dreamed them to be. Barefoot Tom, balancing a piece of straw on his nose, Huck Finn with a dead cat, Tom and puppy in church, Injun Joe- terrifying....each one pulls me in to read the text. The fabulous, wrapping cover art is also printed at the end of the book, so won't be lost if the dust jacket is damaged. The sewn binding is well constructed and the book lays nearly flat when open, so you may enjoy all of the pictures and layout without damaging the book. The inclusion of a pale blue place marking ribbon is a lovely touch. There is a thoughtful biography of Mark Twain proceeding the story. Also, provided are the author's and illustrators notes.
I have a boy, six going on seven. He is a reader and is happy to consume Magic Tree House and Box Car Children books at alarming speed under the covers at night when he is supposed to be asleep. I'll admit I was missing our former habit of reading together. So we read classics aloud together as a family. For less money than a video game this book will provide hours of family entertainment. I hope my son will be inspired to read it again and again. It will have a place in our library and be a reference for years to come. It is heirloom quality. It would make a very special gift to a favorite boy of any age. In fact, I am considering getting another copy for my father, who loves Twain.
Incidentally, not being able to ascertain the quality of this book through the Amazon web site, I went to a little local bookstore where I could put my hands on it first. I ended up buying it there, paying full price- about $5 more than Amazon was asking. They wrapped the book for free in nice heavy paper and since there was no shipping- I think I came out better for it. Before my son had opened this package, he knew it was a book to be awed by. Awesome it is- mostly for Mark Twains' masterful kntting of prose, but also for the cover and publishing. I am writing this review primarily because I was having trouble deciphering from the descriptions which editions would make a nice ""set"" of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. This is an excellent ""set"":

The text is smallish, and the books contain black and white illustrations. They look nice together and are similarly designed and the same size. I got paperbacks.
Of course we all (I hope) know that the stories are excellent, which is why i felt compelled to comment on the style of the particular edition. I bought them for a high school freshman and I think they are just about the right amount of ""grown up' but with just enough pictures to help make them (in particular Huck Finn, which can be a harder read) a little more teen-friendly. The illustrations in no way turn these into 'childrens books' so I don't think that she will feel too old to read them. Of course, the books, and in particular Tom Sawyer, could be read by younger kids, i'm just focusing on what is sometimes known as the ""cool factor."" I read this in preparation for James. I realized it had been so long ago since reading it. A short, fun, read. I do appreciate Mark Twains' descriptive writing. You feel like you know the village and the people. ""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" was Twain's somewhat serious tale of a boy coming of age on the Mississippi River. It was also a wonderful social commentary of the times in which it takes place. ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"" on the other hand, gives us a fun glimpse into the life of one young boy in a fictitious town on the Mississippi River in Missouri. It's definitely the funnier of the two novels, even though it deals with the very real dangers of running off alone, thieves, murderers, and even slacking off on memorizing Sunday school verses. Tom gets into trouble without even thinking about it. He, Huck Finn and a wonderful cast of characters spend their days cutting class, playing pirates, pretending to be Robin Hood, get lost in a cave and even hunt for treasure. It's a grand tale told on a grand scale and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure in the Americana vein.

**Potential Spoiler**
One character that I'd like to single out is the murderous Injun Joe. As loving and protective as Jim is in ""Huck Finn,"" Joe is completely the opposite. He strikes fear into Tom and all of his friends and is the primary catalyst for much of the second half of the book. He's one of the best villains around and his fate (as far as children's books are concerned) is one of the most upsetting. It's amazing how Twain could find a perfect fit for such a wicked character in such a fun book.
**End Spoiler**

I'm sure that an intellectual could digest this book in greater style than I and reveal countless points on morality, religion, ethics, etc., but for most readers (young and old), this is simply a great adventure. Whether you're fourteen or forty, you'll love this book. Highly recommended. The plot is sensational, the characters are spellbinding, the writing is engaging.
Chain of events is priceless and there are enough turns to keep the reader guessing right till the final reveal. Como não há edição nacional pra colecionador resolvi procurar uma importada. Caso alguém queira saber! Essa edição é hardcover. Essa capa azul com detalhes amarelos é uma dust jacket. A capa dura é revestida de tecido azul, a lombada tem inscrição em dourado. As folhas são meio amareladas e um tanto grossas. As ilustrações são bem legais ora no canto da página, ora no centro, ora na margem. Pena que algo assim, com boa tradução, seja só uma esperança... Such a good read about the troubles Tom would get into . This book written about a hundred and fifty years back is an American classic. The book describes the adventures of teenagers Tom Sawyer and his friend Huck in those good old days.
To confess, I had long ago heard of Tom Sawyer but did not have the chance to read the book. It deserves all the praise heaped on it.
Before you have finished thirty pages, you will have fallen in love with Tom Sawyer. I was again and again reminded of Dennis the Menace! The various adventures, fun and frolic will cast a spell on the reader. Older readers will fondly reminisce about their childhood days.
The writer, Mark Twain displays mastery over the language too – choosing apt slang for the dialogues, and depicting other emotional scenes in superb prose.
Another remarkable thing about the story is that there are enough surprises and twists. This is done so skillfully that the reader may not be even aware of it. A lesson to some of the present-day writers (top) who breathe and growl and groan trying to add twists in their tales at every turn of a chapter (especially the last line).
The last chapter of the book, especially, is simply superb – filled with memorable lines.
If you have not read the book, go grab it.
Five stars all the way. Excelente empastado y calidad del libro."
The Federalist Papers (AmazonClassics Edition),"Hailed by Thomas Jefferson as “the best commentary on the principles of government which was ever written,” The Federalist Papers is a collection of eighty-five essays published by Founding Fathers Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay from 1787 to 1788, as a means to persuade the public to ratify the Constitution of the United States.
With nearly two-thirds of the essays written by Hamilton, this enduring classic is perfect for modern audiences passionate about his work or seeking a deeper understanding of one of the most important documents in US history.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from iconic authors. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or revisit an old favorite, these new editions open the door to the stories and ideas that have shaped our world.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Federalist Papers, this edition of The Federalist Papers (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. If you want to understand the Constitution, you should read the Federalist Papers. They present, at great length, the rationale for discarding the Articles of Confederation and adopting the Constitution. You really can't claim to understand the Constitution, how it works, how it fits together, and how it was intended to fit together without reading these articles. (I picked this up on the recommendation of Justice Scalia, and he was absolutely right about this being a must-read to understand the Constitution.)

(A quick note on this particular edition of the Federalist Papers: while it self-describes as an ""enriched classic"", it is not especially enriched. As is proper, the book includes a copy of the Constitution and its amendments -- although strangely it omits the 27th Amendment despite being published well after its ratification. [There is no included copy of the Articles of Confederation, unfortunately -- I'd definitely have found such a copy helpful, particularly since I had no other access to them when reading the book.] A notes section which explains the cultural and historical references scattered throughout the papers. A brief 7-page ""Interpretive Notes"" section discusses the context for the Federalist Papers. A ""Critical Excerpts"" section discusses early reactions to and scholarship concerning the Federalist Papers up to the present day. And there's a couple pages of questions and a few suggestions for further learning for the interested reader. Does this spare additional material really an ""enriched classic"" make?

There's something to be said for providing the unvarnished text, with explanatory notes that are informative but not interpretive; it's much easier for the reader to form his own opinions, uninfluenced by the biases of a commentator, when the Federalist Papers stand on their own. This is for the most part the strategy this book follows. Yet I would not call this book, for following that strategy, an ""enriched classic"". If you're looking for analysis of each paper in context with the papers themselves, this is not the book for you.)

The entire series is long, consisting of 85 papers of various lengths. Yet it's well worth reading and slogging through, even if you have to contend with the 1780s style of highly-educated writing to do it.

That said, I would strongly recommend not attempting to read it the way one might read any old book, starting at the beginning, reading a bunch at a stretch, then reading a bunch more at a stretch, until the entire series is read. Instead, read a paper at a time, then spend some time to think it over. Consider the arguments and how they fit together; look at how they relate to the modern day; consider what was missed in the initial analysis. Giving each article the time it requires will make this book take considerably longer than the average book of 630 pages (not including text after the articles) would take. But it's worth it.

(For a little context, I started this book a couple weeks before an Appalachian Trail thru-hike, expecting at some point to finish it and leave it in a shelter for some other hiker to read, at which point I'd pick up another book and do the same thing, as many times as it took to finish the hike. I didn't even finish this book over those 139 days of hiking, only on the flight home -- it's that dense and worthy of thought. And it's not like I was distracted by other reading, either: I only read one other book in full during that time, plus a couple hundred pages of another. And even reading with that deliberateness, I'm sure I'd get more out of it if I spent the time to read it again.) The American Republic. What an unequalled and brilliant diamond in a world covered in coal. It is so sad after reading this book (The Federalist Papers) that I finally find the reality I have been seeking. The pieces have fallen into place after a lifetime of reading other works and wondering why I and others were so frustrated at the course America was taking. The fourty year rain of the Liberal left in Congress seemed a departure from the American Dream but it would not solidify in a true understanding of the problem. That is no longer the case. I now see that many of our leaders are shredding this magnificent creation into fodder for their own ambitions, corruption, political, personal and deviant pleasures. We have betrayed Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison and Jay by letting party loyalty blind us to the truth. Unfortuantely the battle has become one of good and evil, right and wrong and bipartisanship is nothing more than a covert effort to gain compromise in only one direction, to the extreme, fanatical left. The left has so corrupted the original intent of our Constitution that it is by their pathetic interpretation nearly unrecognizable today. After reading numerous books, I.E. the Bible, the Book of Virtues, Slouching Towards Gomorrah, Out of Order, We Hold These Truths and numerous others. In addition to being a life long student of the Magna Carta, Declaration of Independence, Articles of Confederation and the Constitution itself. I found it unavoidable in todays atmosphere to go any further with the vast number of books addressing the current crises facing our country and this president without first reading the Federalist Papers. A task I had to date, failed to do. But I knew that if High Crimes and Misdemeanors or the Death or Outrage were to mean anything to me, I needed this valuable knowledge of our founders intent. I now see that it is the only real definitive authority on what was intended by the Founders. This book is a must for any American from either side of the isle who really and truely looks for the truth and who desires to honestly make an informed and patriotic decision about the terrible disgrace brought upon our nation by the crew on the bridge of this ship of state called America. We need a new crew and we need one immediately. America is adrift on a sea of deviance, corruption, lies and betayal. ""We the People"" have been gut shot by an administration that cares for nothing but power. The Federalist Papers to the true student of our history will allow no other conclusion and if one hopes to think him or herself worthy of standing in the shadow of those great minds of our nations birth they must accept the truth. How little and insignificant we have made ourselves in their wake. It's a great refresher for essays that we had to read many years ago. An amazing book and a must read. Hamilton and Madison were Greats and their Philosophy and Ideology is perhaps the most Effective and Just system out there that maximises Liberty.

The book however was not in the best shape when it arrived Clássico de literatura!!
Este livro como um dos grandes clássicos da literatura influenciou gerações de escritores e leitores, de modo que se tornou atemporal.
Vale a pena dua leitura.
Super recomendo. The Federalist Papers are a fascinating insight into the thinking of the men who created the original version of the US Constitution; the things they feared (often wisely) and the stalwarts they trusted in (occasionally foolishly). The Papers are also a magnificent work of persuasive writing, with well-crafted phrases and an internal structure in each essay that is often a pleasure to examine.

In evaluating them for what they are - the work of gifted but fallible men - and understanding the debates that produced them, it is possible to understand a lot more about the modern US.

This edition is nicely laid out and clear about where each essay has been taken from, when it was published there, and who (probably) wrote it. connaître les fondations des Etats Unis !"
Oliver Twist (AmazonClassics Edition),"Orphaned at birth to labor in a workhouse, Oliver Twist is barely ten when he flees for London. There he befriends young Jack Dawkins, who educates the innocent Oliver in the ways of survival. When Jack draws Oliver into a gang of juvenile pickpockets, tutored by the unscrupulous Fagin, Oliver’s corruptive influences grow. But for a boy taught only wrong, Oliver must hold on to what he knows is right.
In Oliver Twist, Charles Dickens furiously condemns the realities of nineteenth-century England and rewards those who can escape them still pure at heart.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Oliver Twist, this edition of Oliver Twist (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I've always loved the story of Oliver Twist-now I finally have an illustrated copy I'm even happier. This book is an unabridged copy and is searchable-a great feature. The cover has a picture of Oliver, all ragged with his little bundle. The table of contents takes you to Charles Dickens' preface, which is well worth reading, and to any chapter in the book. Alas, it does not take you to any of the illustrations, but they are beautifully rendered and very clear. I have the most basic Kindle and I have no trouble seeing all of the detail in the illustrations. The chapter headings list not only the number of the chapter, but the brief description Dickens wrote for each chapter, so that if you want to find a particular spot-say, when Oliver runs away to London, you can see that Chapter VIII has the summary ""Oliver walks to London. He encounters on the road a strange sort of young gentleman."" This makes it very easy to go to any part of the book you want to read.

Warning: SPOILERS!!!!

The story is one of a poor orphan boy, sold to an undertaker and abused until he runs away to London. He falls in with thieves and through a strange twist of fate is rescued by the man who was his father's best friend. It's a long story, filled with reversals of fortune and amazing coincidences, and although it has a happy ending, there is some genuine tragedy. It's a very sad scene when Oliver returns to the orphanage to get his best friend, Dick, who saw him off on his journey to London, only to find that Dick has died of untreated sickness. The prostitute, Nancy, has all the attributes of a character in a Greek tragedy-you desperately want her to leave the streets and her brutal boyfriend, Bill Sikes, and when she refuses to go, you have a sinking feeling that she isn't going to last much longer. When he beats her to death in their little room, it's a gruesome scene, but not a surprising one. The only relief from Fagin's gang comes from Charley, who reforms and leaves London to become a grazier.

A word about Fagin-some might find the constant description of him as ""the Jew"" offensive. It is not meant as a pejorative, but rather as a handy label to define the arch-criminal. While it is true that Fagin is constantly described as a Jew and is one of the most repulsive Jewish characters in literature, it was not Dickens' intent to cast slurs upon Jewish people. He wrote in good faith and was troubled later, after becoming friends with Eliza Davis, the wife of the Jewish banker he sold his London house to, by the way he had portrayed Fagin. Eliza wrote to him in 1863 that she considered the way Dickens had portrayed Fagin a great wrong to the Jewish people. Dickens started to revise Oliver Twist, removing over 180 instances of the word ""Jew"" from the first edition text. He also ommitted sterotypical caricature from his public readings of Oliver Twist and a contemporary report noted, ""There is no nasal intonation; a bent back but no shoulder-shrug: the conventional attributes are omitted."" Dickens was finally able to write to Eliza, ""There is nothing but good will left between me and a People for whom I have a real regard and to whom I would not willfully have given an offence."" Fagin might still give offense to those looking for it, but personally I have always seen him as an example of a bad man, not a Jewish man, and I believe that is how Dickens meant to portray him. If you only read one of Charles Dickens' books, or if you don't know where to start reading his books, I recommend you read Oliver Twist, the unforgettable story of a poor orphan boy, who spent his early years in a work house, before being recruited by a gang of pickpockets.
It's not an easy book to read, and is not meant for children or the faint of heart, because it portrays some harsh events, many of which Dickens had experienced himself, or had personally investigated, and that is one of the main attractions of this book; It's real. You may read about child labour and the plight of the many orphaned children in Victorian England, but no history book will describe a workhouse, the inside of a prison, the starving dogs and hungry rats, the life of a pickpocket, a thief, a pimp, or a gang leader, a public hanging, or the cruelty of London slums, the way Dickens does.
Read it if you want to know what really happened, what the streets, people and life was like for Victorian Londoners.
I never tire of rereading it myself. Dramatic, yes, exaggerated, I doubt it, realistic, shockingly.
The plot is a page turner, and the characters come to life in every scene. We see their gestures, smell their ragged clothes and listen to their lies and truths.
I love Dickens' use of the English language. It may be wordy by contemporary standards, but it’s smoothly done. A real pleasure to read for anyone who loves the English language and wants to take a short trip to Victorian London.
A book to read once and reread all your life.
Although I usually read my paperback, this free kindle version makes it even easier to read. A big thank you to the volunteers who made this edition possible.
As a writer, I often read a random chapter or passage before I sit down to write. Dickens humbles me, but he also gives me great encouragement by showing me how the English language can convey so much using the right combination of words.
‘Capital!’ As Dickens would say. SIX Stars or more, the story draws on genius.
The Victorian era! This was a horrible time in English history when the so called Upper-class (and those who thought they were) walked all over the poor.
It was in such a time as this that a young feeble woman gave birth to a baby and then died. The child was counted as an orphan and a pauper and therefore a matter for distain and neglect. No one cared what became of him.
He received the barest of care, just enough to keep him alive, and for what? To be used and abused by all who should have been his protectors.
This child is given his name without love or thought but mealy through an alphabet system devised for such births.
He was in the O's for his first name, so received Oliver, and in the T's for his surname, so given the name of Twist.
Oliver entered the work house at the age of seven to work long hours with little food and much abuse and ridicule. Cruelty to such children was used for amusement by those in charge of them. Many children died as they had lived, without knowing any love or nurturing. And no one cared.
The story takes you on a journey of such hardship that you will be unable to fathom how such evil was allowed.
Yet good times do come and when they do, the reader feels that at last there is some justice in the world.
This is a classic novel of those times written with very descriptive language. Some of which used by the poor was atrocious.
One such manner of speech is the Headline I have used for the review... often said almost as an oath to prove reality. Que é um livro muito bom! I got the Everyman’s Library Hardcover copy of the book. It really is something special.
The novel itself is, well what can I say? It’s a classic. If you can get this novel at the sale price, I highly recommend it; the quality is just amazing.

Things that were done well:
- the font size and style; makes it easy to read and Cohesive
- binding of the book is perfect
Lives up to the Everyman’s Library standard.
Things I like:
- the chronology of the author
- the introduction; gives great insight into the novel
What I don’t like:
- the ribbon bookmark; it is not tied at the end, so with frequent use or just normal use, it will start unraveling which is unfortunate.

Overall thoughts on this publisher:
If you love this story or you want an edition that will last for generations, pick this up. Everyman’s Library just does a wonderful job at making timepieces. Seriously, there was a lot of time and energy into thinking about all the little details that really makes all of the difference
- colour coding of the cloth that the book is bound in,
- the spine of the books all line up, with or without the jacket on
- edges and paper are uniform
- good size to hold with one hand for reading and for travelling too The quality is of the book is good. The story itself is an abridged version which is not too good. Ein schöner Klassiker! Spannend!"
The Communist Manifesto (AmazonClassics Edition),"With its message of working-class empowerment and call for unity, The Communist Manifesto endures as one of history’s most influential, visionary, and controversial documents. Intending to rouse readers from their indifference, authors Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels demanded the end of proletariat exploitation and called for the overthrow of the oppressive bourgeois ruling class. It was a blueprint for an uncompromising new direction that would serve as the spark for the socialist uprising in the late 1800s.
Today, The Communist Manifesto reverberates fully and fittingly in the polarized political climate of the twenty-first century.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Communist Manifesto, this edition of The Communist Manifesto (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I really enjoyed this book. It’s a quick read and his theory is very aligned with cultural reality. Socialism works mainly based on the culture of people. So does communism. You have to be open minded and approach this reading as general knowledge that helps you to understand other sciences (e.g., economics, philosophy, sociology, politics). You cannot expect to understand any one science by reading or studying that one subject area only. This book is a go to for understanding world politics and history. Very nice book. Very well interpretation of Karl Marx’s writing. Came with fast shipping. I bought 30 of these to hand out at school, and there was so much demand! I managed to hand out all of them within a day, people were so excited to get a copy of it. We all took ours to the Mexican Bakery. The content is also really good, it's very enlightening and brings some interesting thoughts to mind. Me and my friends have had some really good discussions about communism. This version is also quite nice, it's just the manifesto, no unnecessary filler that some other versions have, it makes it much lighter to carry around and smaller, and makes it so that it's all communism, all the time. My main critique and the reason for the only 4 stars is that although this version is cheap, having to spend money for it goes against the communist vision, which is why I give them away for free, but it's cheaper here than most other places. Would very highly recommend!!!!!!! Marx and Engels wrote The Communist Manifesto in 1848 at the request of the Communist League, a secret association of workers driven underground by political oppression aimed at preventing concerted revolutionary activity against bourgeois regimes throughout Europe. The Manifesto was written to provide a theoretical foundation and a practical program for the advancement of international communism and eventual elimination of bourgeois domination of property-less wage laborers.

The title of the document, simple and purely descriptive though it is, is commonly regarded as inflammatory, arousing derision, disdain, and virulent hostility among many, including those whom it was written to benefit. Nevertheless, there is much in the Manifesto, especially in the first chapter, that with the aid of hindsight could have been written by a contemporary neo-conservative intellectual, someone like Harvard sociologist Daniel Bell.

Specifically, Marx and Engels begin with a tribute to the unparalleled productive capacity of the capitalist organization of production. They freely laud the technological innovations fostered by capitalists' pursuit of surplus value, a process that has dramatically transformed the forces of production and the social relations of production. The result has been rapidly expanding output of industrial and agricultural goods of all kinds.

In accomplishing this, capital has extended its markets beyond national borders, creating a world market and a world economy. Raw materials from Latin America, Africa, and Asia are routinely used to manufacture finished goods in England, Germany, and other European countries. The same manufactured goods may then be sold in the very places that supplied the raw materials.

All this, Marx and Engels observe, requires concentration of vast numbers of people in swollen industrial cities. Small manufacturers and family farms are swallowed up by larger enterprises with which they have neither the capital nor productive capacity to compete. Marx and Engels find it particularly noteworthy that men like Thomas Jefferson had envisioned America as a land of independent yeoman farmers with small land holdings, but the concentration of agriculture was rendering this vision obsolete.

As we get farther into this brief document, Daniel Bell, the other neo-conservatives, and people generally may take angry exception to its tone and substance.

Concentration of resources in capital-intensive enterprises, Marx and Engels argue, reduces the vast majority of people to the degraded status of wage labor, workers who own nothing but their labor power. It is in the interests of the bourgeoisie -- of capital -- to pay workers as little as possible, increasing surplus value by buying labor power for no more than its natural price, the amount needed to survive and reproduce.

The culture of workers is nothing more than a brutalizing culture of production, lacking in scope and richness due to the pitifully small part that each worker plays in the overall production process. Families of working people are men, women, and children who labor for the natural price and have little time, energy or emotional sustenance to offer each other, having been wrung dry by capital's conditions of employment.

The more productive the worker, the more he or she strengthens the hand of capital. However, capital's immense productive power and its success in keeping wage rates abysmally low are not an unmixed blessing for the bourgeoisie. Periodic over-production crises wreck havoc with national and international markets, undercutting profits and threatening the commanding position of capital. As a timely example, the U.S. economy is currently approximating an over-production crisis: unemployment is high, wages are low and falling, capital has roughly two and a half trillion dollars to invest, but in the absence of demand the bourgeoisie has become risk averse, and money is not being invested in productive endeavors.

The long-term solution to all this, for Marx and Engels, is elimination of bourgeois property and the property relations that capitalism has created. This is not to say that private property must altogether disappear, but private property as capital, as that which creates a two-class system of exploitation of labor by the bourgeoisie, certainly must cease to exist.

Marx and Engels were entirely too sanguine about the eventual joining together of members of the working class to present a united front in their conflict with capital. They realized that there were ethnic, racial, religious, national, linguistic, occupational, and other barriers that would be difficult to overcome, but I doubt they expected the workers of the world to be as fractionated as is currently the case. If Marx and Engels were alive today, they might take the view that things would have to get much worse for labor before a revolution becames possible.

If you're not inclined to read the Manifesto, just read the introductory remarks by Vladimir Posner, once a member of the Communist Party of the USSR. Posner spent much of his childhood and adolescence in the West, and his insights into the appeal of communist ideals and the failure of the USSR to develop communism as Marx and Engels sketchily envisioned it are extremely interesting. Posner is no apologist for anything, just an honest and intelligent journalist whose idealism is genuine but far from boundless or excessive. The first thing that needs to be said about this pamphlet is that any fool can read it (or most likely not read it) and then say: ""duh, communism is terrible."" That's a bit like finding out which horse ran a certain race and then declaring that it was obvious which horse would win. The fact is that when this pamphlet (it's not a book) was first published in 1848 it hardly attracted any attention at all - and that is probably the most apt review - you can be liked, damned or, worst of all, ignored. But if you were reviewing it in 1848, without the knowledge of what communism would really do, what would you say?
Looking at the major themes the first thing that comes to mind is that this pamphlet ignores the writings of the great Enlightenment philosophers and that alone should have been a significant warning of what may lay ahead.
Secondly, it calls for the forcible removal of all property from private hands. Surely that would indicate that much blood would be spilled in the process. And that removal of course would be carried out by bloodthirsty thugs. In the 18th century Thomas Paine warned that violent revolutions take on a life of their own and often end in an all encompassing conflagration. His observations were based on personal experience.
Thirdly Marx and Engels write as if every statement they make are self evident truths - so ultimately embracing their thinking becomes a matter of faith - and that leads me to another observation which should have been obvious at the time. That observation is that this pamphlet purports to be a panacea and is very similar to most other solutions which involve the acceptance of an all embracing set of ideas, whether it be religious or political. Ideas that may never be questioned or scrutinized, ideas which must be accepted as articles of faith, with severe penalties for a breach of that faith, e.g., execution or imprisonment or eternal damnation in some ""other"" life.
Essentially any set of beliefs which ignores our human instincts (which communism surely does) is doomed to cause strife. We are mostly an acquisitive tribe that demands a certain level of autonomy, within a social contract. We don't all want the same things at the same time, so a centrally planned economy would soon not meet our various needs. We want to own and control the things we purchase with our skill and labor. Importantly we are, to varying degrees creative, a characteristic which requires the freedom to find solutions and be rightly rewarded for the risk and initiative. We want to improve things and often that means challenging the present order and hierarchy, i.e. challenging the articles of faith. In short the foregoing were all destined to run aground under communist ideology. But we should recognize that fascism, in particular, and most, if not all, religions contain many strictures which clash with humanity. Implementation of faith based panaceas always involves coercion and are mostly maintained with threats of violence or other retributions, in this life of the ""next"". That should be our warning. As it should be: short, objective, simple but yet very deep.
Everyone should read this book.
Workers from all the world: unite! Very good, no frills edition of the text. What more could you want? Worked well It is worth reading the book to get an understanding of what the de-facto founders of communism thought.

Luckily, the book is short and a quick read. It feels to be composed of two parts: their understanding of the evolution from feudalism to capitalism and the overall environment at the time, plus their understanding of what communism should be.

Based on the book, it seems that the countries that claimed to be communist were mostly communist, as the main principle seemed to be to abolish private property.

It is also clear that Marx and Engels did not understand human psychology. They also did not have the foresight to realize that in communism, the ruling class ownership (the single party) would replace private property or that there would even be a ruling class and that a much worse type of oppression would replace the injustices of the time.

Based on their definition of communism, it is also clear that China is no longer a communist country but a one-party rule country - an oligarchy. Marx is a true philosopher and genius, he outlines the principles of communism very clearly in the Manifesto. It is a constant debate between the bourgeois way and the communist way, although it is obviously leaned completely towards communism.

Marx was a talented writer and this is reflected in the manifesto, not a word is wasted and it is written in such beautiful wording. It is interesting to read his principles of communism and then to study how overs have interpreted them and created there own versions of communism, e.g Maoism, Starlinism. Each time the communist ideas stray further from the original principles outlined in the manifesto so excellently by Marx. There were hundreds of Manifestos written in 1888 it says something about this one seen as it is still been read avidly by many today.

If you have any interests in communism then you must read this, let Marxism live on."
Macbeth (AmazonClassics Edition),"One night on the heath, the brave and respected general Macbeth encounters three witches who foretell that he will become king of Scotland. At first skeptical, he’s urged on by the ruthless, single-minded ambitions of Lady Macbeth, who suffers none of her husband’s doubt. But seeing the prophecy through to the bloody end leads them both spiraling into paranoia, tyranny, madness, and murder.
This shocking tragedy—a violent caution to those seeking power for its own sake—is, to this day, one of Shakespeare’s most popular and influential masterpieces.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds. Lies, deceit, treachery, poison, knives in the night, justified paranoia, guilt, revenge... it is all there, and more, in this classic story of how the lust for power can literally drive people crazy. It can also kill them. I first read this play of William Shakespeare as a high school reading assignment, the way the vast majority of people do. Lo’ these many years later, I’ve undertaken a project of re-reading a lot of those H.S. reading assignments, including the plays of Shakespeare, in part to determine how much I missed the first time around, which, in two short words is normally: a lot.

The play is set in Scotland. The king is Duncan. His not faithful lord, called “thane” in Scotland at the time, is Macbeth. And he has a wife who has become a symbol of all wives who relentlessly push their husbands to be “successful,” and who is normally addressed with the misnomer of “Lady.” (“That’s no lady, that’s my wife”...but I digress). As Cliff Notes will tell you, Duncan is murdered in his sleep, with those proverbial “long knives.” Macbeth skillfully diverts the blame to his body guards, who are conveniently also killed (a death man tells no tales) while also casting suspicion on Duncan’s sons, who have fled for their lives to further shores. How many times, throughout all the cultures and civilizations of the world, has this scenario basically unfolded?

Throughout many of his plays Shakespeare utilizes elements from the ancient Greek plays, such as prophecy and a “chorus” that predicts future events, often esoterically. In this play, Shakespeare uses three witches around a cauldron, stirring, and if there is one line that most people remember from the play, it is the first line of their chorus: “Double, double, toil and trouble.”

A fellow Amazon reviewer noted a quip that Shakespeare’s plays are simply quotes strung together, a humorous way of noting that many portions of the play have entered the popular, albeit intellectual portion, of our culture. For example, after the first Iraq War (yeah, I know, it is hard to say which one was the first one now), the cover to the “The Economist” featured the line: “When the hurlyburly’s done.” My first high school reading failed me, and I had no idea this was a reference to a line in Macbeth’s opening scene, with the second line being: “When the battle’s lost and won.” And is that battle lost or won? Proving the enduring relevance of Shakespeare in so many settings, later in the same scene he writes: “Her husband’s to Aleppo gone, master o’ the Tiger.” I haven’t seen “The Economist” use that line to refer to its British citizens going to fight for ISIS.

Another quote that I remembered, and life experience has proven to be so true: “Sleep that knits up the ravel’d sleeve of care.” Hum. Another quote that life experience proves true: “Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him... makes him stand to and not stand to...” Finally, so that I literally don’t quote the entire play, another classic scene that personally resonated, due to my travels, was Lady Macbeth’s efforts to wash the blood off her hands, and she proclaims: “All the perfume of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.”

Another excellent, still so relevant play of Shakespeare, that needs to read more than twice. 5-stars, plus. This is a review of the Kindle version of this book. I am not reviewing Macbeth. I think I'm safe in guessing most of you already have an opinion on the play and are more curious about what this edition adds, so I will limit my review to that.

The book starts with a few essays before we get to the play. One of these is a nice, but brief, introduction to the play; another is a look at Shakespeare's life and time, his theater, and the publication of his plays. Of particular interest to those unfamiliar with the Bard is an essay giving some tips, suggestions, and ideas on how to read and understand the text. This essay contains short sections on Shakespeare's words, his sentences, his wordplay, the language he uses specifically in Macbeth, and the implied stage directions that can be read in the text. Although this essay is relatively short, it is a nice introduction to all of these things and will help novices understand the play a little better.

The play itself is not annotated directly, so one can read the original text with no help if one wants to. The text is, however, marked-up with a number of hot-links to endnotes and it is these endnotes which helpfully explain the play. They cover various things ranging from simple vocab, phrases, and references to more complicated passages. Overall these notes are well done and explain nearly everything one could want explained quite well.

There is an additional section at the end which contains longer notes on certain things. There are also hot-links to these from the shorter notes.

All of this jumping around in the text, following link after link, works relatively well. The Kindle software is slowly getting better and it handles the links well enough for one to enjoy the book.

In addition to these two notes sections, there is another essay which looks at a modern perspective of the play. This is followed by a lengthy list of further reading along which is quite nice. Next is a listing, with hot-links, of some of the more famous lines in the play.

Overall, I was very happy with this book. The notes were enough to help me through the text and the various essays were interesting. I have not read any of the other ""helper"" books for the play, so I can't compare, but I'd fully recommend this one. I'm not rating Macbeth, of course. It's a great play. What I'm rating is this edition of the text.

This is a good one. So far as I can see, the difference between good and bad eEditions of Shakespeare is first and foremost a question of whether the lines of the poetry have been preserved. Not all editions do this, which leaves the reader with a weird mishmash of paragraphs with capital letters sprinkled throughout the text. This approach - let's call it the Approach of Sloth - leaves a text that's unreadable.

But this text is fine. It's a safe choice. Due to the lack of line numbers I cannot take this copy to the exam Evidentemente, Macbeth é um clássico e todo clássico deveria ser lido um dia. Talvez quem nunca tomou conhecimento sobre a obra tenha ao menos uma vaga noção de um rei, algumas bruxas, algum sangue, alguma batalha. Macbeth é uma história sobre ambição desmedida, sobre insanidade, violência e crueldade. O personagem Macbeth é o valente general do rei Duncan e se destaca nas batalhas recentes. Sua ambição é despertada por feiticeiras que o saúdam como futuro rei. Ao hospedar Duncan, Macbeth ainda tem dúvidas sobre o ato, porém, pressionado pela esposa, comete o regicídio. Daí em diante, Macbeth afunda em sangue. Parece buscar na quantidade de crimes uma forma de anestesiar o primeiro assassinato. Lady Macbeth, de início tão segura e determinada, é tomada pelo peso do crime, a visão e o cheiro do sangue a perseguem, e ela tira a própria vida. Depois de cometer diversos assassinatos para se manter no poder, Macbeth é derrotado pelas forças inglesas que apoiam o herdeiro legítimo do trono, o filho mais velho do rei Duncan.

O livro é excelente. As dúvidas iniciais de Macbeth acerca do crime, sua gradual transformação em sanguinário e sem limites, as visões e aparições que ambos, ele e sua esposa, presenciam, todo o sobrenatural da peça, tudo isso é marcante. As cenas em que as feiticeiras aparecem estão entre as melhores. Percebo nelas, além da maldade e da falsidade, uma alegria malévola e até infantil. É relevante observar que momentos cruciais da história, e da peça teatral, não são mostrados, ou seja, são apenas subentendidos e referidos depois pelos personagens: assim, o assassinato de Duncan por Macbeth, o momento em que Lady Macbeth vai ao quarto do rei assassinado deixar as adagas, o suicídio de Lady Macbeth. Observe-se, também, que é o fantasma de Banquo que assombra Macbeth, não o do rei Duncan. Na peça, não se esclarece a forma como Banquo dará origem a uma casa real, algo que foi previsto pelas feiticeiras, visto que Macbeth é derrotado e sucedido pelo herdeiro legítimo de Duncan.

Uma obra inesquecível, sombria, sanguinária e valiosa. Macbeth is well worth reading again. It is short and fast-paced and has so many memorable lines. This Foger ebook edition is ideal for reading Shakespeare on an e-reader. The edition also has better introductory essays than the typical Folger edition. Best play/book ever written.
Good quality book with copious references which really enhance the story.
Reread more than any other book."
Notes from the Underground (AmazonClassics Edition),"Isolated from society in a tenement basement in St. Petersburg, a malicious former civil servant vents his resentments. In the rambling notes that follow, we are exposed to the inner turmoil of the Underground Man, who represents the voice of his generation. An emotional, paranoid knot of contradictions, the spiteful narrator is also desperate to join a society he loathes, if only to prove his superiority to it.
Exploring themes of free will versus determinism, Dostoyevsky’s existential exploration was written to challenge increasingly popular Western egoist philosophies. In the Underground Man, he found the embodiment of the antihero, whose behavior—like all human behavior—defies rationalization.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Notes from the Underground, this edition of Notes from the Underground (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Dostoyevsky is Dostoyevsky, and if you care about literature you will read his great works if you haven't already. But what makes this edition of one of those great works, Notes from Underground, great is that it is combined with other shorter works from different periods in his life. Dostoyevsky is serious stuff. Living in a time and a place of brutal oppression, he could do nothing else but write about the serious questions of life. And through the writings chosen for this collection, we can see the progression of his thoughts and beliefs as he aged.

We start with `White Nights', a story of selflessness in which a young man helps a girl connect with her love even though he loves her too. Though this story has the grave tone common of 19th century Russian literature, it has a tinge of hopefulness in the man's sacrifice. This is the young and idealistic Dostoyevsky, before he was jailed for having `revolutionary ideas' and sentenced to death only to be pardoned moments from being shot. Obviously this had a great impact on his mind and went a long way towards destroying any hopefulness he had. The transition is seen in the three stories selected from The House of the Dead, his first successful work. Written in 1862, or about a decade after his imprisonment, these stories tell of senseless murderers and corporal punishers. Almost entirely devoid of emotion, we can see a Dostoyevsky who has gone inward and narrates simply and pragmatically. Life has become a matter of survival, with no room for the sentimentality of the protagonist in `White Nights'.

Then in the main event, Notes from Underground, the emotion is back, but it has been transformed into anger and hatred in the form of the bitter and isolated narrator. There is much existentialist (this work is considered the founding work of existentialism) rambling in the first part, as he debates with us, the reader (even though these are his memoirs, not a two way discussion) about logic and determinism, arguing that man will not always do what's best for himself, as propounded by the utopians of the time, but will often act in direct antagonism towards themselves to display `individualism'. And, as he is an `individual', he cannot act properly in society, which is why he is now isolated and bitter. Then he gets into a proper narrative in Part II, as he demonstrates his ideas to us with stories from his earlier life. There are three parts to this, but the most interesting is the last: his brief encounter with a prostitute, where he shows the inkling of decency and love towards her, but rejects her when she returns it. Despite feeling much revulsion for the narrator to this point, there is a sense of poignancy at this end for him, and perhaps reflects both Dostoyevsky's struggle with society after his imprisonment, and our admiration for him despite his nihilistic views.

The collection closes with Dream of a Ridiculous Man, a story written just a few years before his death. In it, a man decides life is meaningless and wants to commit suicide. He chances upon a little girl whose mother needs help, but he brushes the girl away. He then goes home, feels guilty, falls asleep, and has a dream. In the dream he goes to a utopia where everyone is happy until heteaches them to lie and ruins the society. He awakens a changed man who only wants to love others as himself. Near the end of his life, Dostoyevsky had found God. Part 1 consists of continuous rambling from the narrator in a stream of conscience way which was hard to follow. By the time it hit part 2, it felt more so like storytelling which was easier to follow and more entertaining for me. Overall, the book was not bad but if I were to read any part again, it would be part 2. Perfect.

This man could be any man, in any place, today. And these qualities are the ones that define universal literature. Being my first book of Dostoyevsky I can declare unabashedly this book the work of a genius. This is the testimony of a man that cheats himself into thinking his self-exile and poverty is the product of a despised society that doesn't recognize his genius (and this made me recall Oscar Wilde's short tale ""The Remarkable Rocket""). His life is so minuscule, so devoid of true life, that the petty and forgettable events that occur to him are in his mind are epic battles. He is afraid to live and his mind is rot in bookish fantasies; but he doesn't cross the threshold of his home and work, rendering himself a prisoner. This is a quite spectacular portrait, nobody, not even the lower beings in the social scale, can feel offense from him due to his miserable life; and the end, without spoiling it, is a so complete insult against the anonymous man, that I couldn't avoid to think in the end of (again) Oscar Wilde's (again) short story ""The Devoted Friend."" I enjoyed it from beginning to end without knowing what to expect.

This book applies to our times too. Social networks, especially Twitter, have armies of persons that spend the time there, making tragedies of forgettable trivialities, commenting them as if each word uttered by them were the most important declaration ever, for a public that barely can register (if they do at all) a fraction of a second before passing to the next post. As in ""Notes from the Underground"" the modern life is harming the humanity of so many. Is the paradox to have potential of more real and diverse human connections but being shy and get stuck only in the written word of books or internet, and unrealistic dreams for the mere fact that they will not move physically to the door to make them real, and they will blame others, victimizing themselves, because in their mind they are geniuses. The irony of writing here, in the loneliness of a borrowed laptop, as if I were writing to an eager audience certainly doesn't escape me x^P

This is another beautiful edition of AmazonClassics. Clean from errors, nice typography, X-Ray, in excellent formatting. The translation is a public domain one, around the end of 19th century I think, but it doesn't feel antiquated, it is a good translation. Amazing book to get. The spiteful man from the underground was announcing the advent of nihilism and revealing in this book wha are the consequences of a man whose moral values had been lost track over the course of his life.
40 years before the soviet union takes place this man had in advance exposed the faliure of a system which is predicted upon no beliefs (structural one).
A man (in the west) who tries to neglect all the belief system upon which our society was predicted on is obviously going to get himself left in miserable because no man can ever create his own values out of nothingness in the short course of his life.
Amazing book.
Disclaimer: Don't allow yourself to drift your soul into someone akin to the underground man. Un libro trasformativo Super schnelle Lieferung alles Bestens 1 + Very nice novel. This is the first novel I’ve read by this author. Goes deep down into the nature of man. Reflected a lot from my life A book talking about a man who isolated himself from society.

The book is basically a man that is thinking, and decided to put everything that he was thinking of on paper, anything that came to his mind was written in his notes; the notes are full of contradictions, regrets, ideas and struggles, and you the reader, are reading these notes.

Can't say that I understood everything philosophical in the book, but it was a good read, I liked it.

If you liked Crime and Punishment you will most probably like this one as well.
If you like to hear the thoughts of a person then this is the book for you. :)"
David Copperfield (AmazonClassics Edition),"After his childhood is turned upside down, orphan David Copperfield is forced to navigate and survive the brutal world of the industrial poor. He’ll cross classes and paths with kindred spirits, extended family, eccentrics, and adversaries. Throughout his journey into adulthood, he’ll be befriended, loved, and conspired against. And each evolving adventure—comic, tragic, and romantic, both at home and abroad—will inform the observant young man’s success as he becomes a novelist.
In his most autobiographical work—the one he considered his “favorite child”—Charles Dickens etched a gallery of indelible characters, including the cruel Murdstone, the recklessly optimistic Micawber, the devious Uriah Heep, and Dora and Agnes, the faithful loves of David’s life. Enduringly popular, David Copperfield is considered by many to be Dickens’s masterpiece.
Revised edition: Previously published as David Copperfield, this edition of David Copperfield (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. 'Never,' said my aunt, 'be mean in anything; never be false; never be cruel. Avoid those three vices, Trot, and I can always be hopeful of you.'

It is because David Copperfield (Trotwood, to his aunt) embodies these virtues that his character and this book are uplifting when so much of the story is filled with sadness. Despite all the hardships he experiences and all the hardships he sees in life around him, his nobility endures. He not only has the strength to see him through many challenges of heart and pocketbook, he lends his strength to those around him who are in need.

The writing is sometimes deeply heartfelt and sometimes buoyantly humorous, but always engaging. Well, maybe not ALWAYS, but much of it is excellent and thought-provoking. I don't think Dickens would fault me for drifting off a time or two in his lengthy classic (which I later regretted). To quote:
""I never thought, when I used to read books, what work it was to write them.' 'It's work enough to read them, sometimes,' I [Copperfield] returned. 'As to the writing, it has its own charms, aunt.

Dickens always introduces us to unique and engaging characters in his novels, and this novel does not disappoint. I was glad to finish this book, but like him, sad to say farewell to those heroes, and even villains, I had spent so much time with and who he so aptly described.

'Clever! She brings everything to a grindstone,' said Steerforth, 'and sharpens it, as she has sharpened her own face and figure these years past. She has worn herself away by constant sharpening. She is all edge.'

He is not unaware of his own faults and failings in his journey to manhood.
'Mr. Creakle cuts a joke before he beats him, and we laugh at it,—miserable little dogs, we laugh, with our visages as white as ashes, and our hearts sinking into our boots.'

There is Dickens' usual commentary on the nature of society and evils it is prone to and the evil its individuals are prone to, as well. His observations are always prescient, and truths, universal.

'""Satan finds some mischief still, for idle hands to do.""' 'Egad, Doctor,' returned Mr. Wickfield, 'if Doctor Watts knew mankind, he might have written, with as much truth, ""Satan finds some mischief still, for busy hands to do."" The busy people achieve their full share of mischief in the world, you may rely upon it. What have the people been about, who have been the busiest in getting money, and in getting power, this century or two? No mischief?'

'It may be profitable to you to reflect, in future, that there never were greed and cunning in the world yet, that did not do too much, and overreach themselves. It is as certain as death.'

Of course, he sees much goodness, too.
'From my swoon, I first awoke to a consciousness of her compassionate tears, her words of hope and peace, her gentle face bending down as from a purer region nearer Heaven, over my undisciplined heart, and softening its pain.'

He has much to say on love and marriage...love and the undisciplined heart, what marriage is founded upon, and the changes and adaptations one must be prepared to make. Things no one knows about or, at least, understands until they have had the experience. Not even Dickens' profound and emotional words can discipline our hearts.

I would love to revisit this novel in the future, understanding what I know now...""yet knowing how way leads on to way...""
Review by R. E. Admore, author of ""Mist and Amethyst"" I LOVE David Copperfield. It is my all-time favorite Dickens - so far. But when my eyes were weary and I just wanted to play mahjong and chill, while being told a brilliant story - Mr. Armitage sincerely brought his A game. I never listen to full audiobooks. It's for unique occasions only but this edition was truly brilliant and brought each and every character to life. I ended up reading along, relistening to specific chapters, paragraphs that gave a higher meaning to the work, and when I finished the book on my own - I went back and I am listening to it again all the way through while I drive. Really. THis is gold. Thank you RA for bringing Dickens and Copperfield to life in a way I had not heard before. Immense enjoyment. :) I recently re-read Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities, and was considering picking up another of his novels. When I saw that a new production of Dickens' semi-autobiographical 1850 novel David Copperfield had just been released narrated by Ralph Cosham, one of my favorite audiobook readers, I eagerly queued the novel up.

David Copperfield chronicles the life, from birth to mid-life, of the title character, and is told in first person from Copperfield's point of view. Many elements of Copperfield's life parallel Dickens' own. Child labor, debtors prisons, and endeavors in law, journalism, and writing all have their origins in Dickens' own experience. Other than optimism, Copperfield is largely shaped by the circumstances he finds himself in and the characters he encounters.

Dickens does a great job of providing fully-formed secondary characters. Attention is paid to the personality and motivation of virtually everyone Copperfield meets, down to waiters, landlords, and coachmen. My three favorite characters in the novel are Mr. Micawber, Betsey Trotwood, and Uriah Heep. Copperfield lives for a time with Mr. Micawber as a boy, and the pair form a strong connection. Mr. Micawber is characterized by pecuniary difficulties, a taste for the verbose, and faith that something will, in short, turn up. He's amusing whenever he turns up. David's great-aunt Betsey Trotwood is a feisty, strong-willed, no-nonsense woman who is, in fact, quite caring towards those who earn her good graces. Uriah Heep is a despicable clerk, who hides his schemes and ambitions in a cloak of humbleness and subservience. My skin crawled whenever he appeared on scene. In addition to memorable characters, Dickens' crafts some fantastic language in this novel. The dialogue, in particular, is quite good, and many a line will stick with me.

The main downside to the story is that there's no central thread to the narrative. While the novel is largely a coming of age story like Dickens' Great Expectation, it lacks any particular goal. Pip strives to become a gentleman and earn Estella's love in Great Expectations, but there's no similar target in Copperfield's mind. He moves from challenge to challenge well enough, but never seems to have any particular direction of his own. While this, most probably, is closer to real life than Pip's goals, it makes for a somewhat meandering novel.

I listened to Blackstone Audio's 2012 production of David Copperfield, narrated by Ralph Cosham. Cosham is a favorite narrator of mine, and he does an excellent job here. The novel contains a very large cast of characters, and Cosham manages to make them all sound distinct and memorable. From the despicably conniving and humble Uriah Heep to the solid and seafaring Mr. Peggotty to the adorable and silly Dora, you know as soon as Cosham starts speaking which character you're listening to. Cosham also does a great job of using timing and volume to set a scene. The hands down best example of this is a scene towards the end of the novel featuring Mr. Micawber and Uriah Heep, which is one of my favorite scenes of the novel, in no small part because of Cosham's performance. The unabridged recording runs approximately 34 hours.

Dickens' David Copperfield is an excellent novel. The lack of central theme holds it back some, but the many interesting and amusing characters and the memorable dialogue makes it worth reading for anyone looking to give Dickens a go. I highly recommend Cosham's performance of the novel to audiobook fans.

Note: I received a complimentary review copy of this audiobook from the publisher. This book is a classic of such stature that I don't think anybody would really care about my opinion of it as literature. I enjoyed reading it as an eBook because I could look up archaic words and phrases immediately. I thought I read it as a child but as I went along, I didn't really remember that much about it. So I wonder now if I really made it through it back then. I am now just turned 70 so I was able to understand it much better than I would have as a ten year old girl. It is long and plodding, I think, to modern tastes. David is such an amazingly well behaved and articulate child that I found it not quite credible. Still, the story is well worth the slog. If I understand correctly, his focus on poor working folks as well as middle class ones was quite revolutionary. The whole Peggotty family are so warm and real that you can't help but love them. I'm glad I got to know them. Steerforth is not as wonderful, but still worth getting to know. So, if you've got the time, I recommend picking it up and giving it a try. There is nothing I can say about one of the greatest pieces of English literature in existence. The Kindle version of Dickens' masterpiece is a great addition to one's library. The dictionary function helps to address the variety of archaic 19th century words. It is a very large volume (1,200) pages so again the Kindle version is a plus. Boa encadernação e tamanho das letras facilita a leitura. Trata-se de obra clássica e de autor renomado. Scritto in un inglese fluente, racconta dettagli inediti e curiosi del grande David Copperfield che vi stupiranno. Molto utile anche per approfondire la lingua inglese, dalla quale escono sfumature della sua vita non sempre intuibili ne sovrapponibili all'edizione italiana. Davvero un bel libro, consigliatissimo! David Copperfield was devilishly fun to read (or listen to - I got the audiobook by David Vance, but I also downloaded a free kindle version). I don't know if Dickens's writing style is so delicious because all nineteenth century writers wrote like that, or because of his wit - probably a combination of both. Plain English is all well and good, but there's a satisfaction to be gained from deciphering a long and winding sentence.

It was a delight to discover if you want to improve your vocabulary and knowledge of Victorian England, this is the most entertaining way to do it. Vocabulary wise: I learned so many words (whereas in the past you had to lose momentum to look up a word in a dictionary, Kindle's dictionary made this so much quicker). Victorian England wise: I learned that lots of people died young back then, there were widows and widowers all over the shop, people walked bloody everywhere and for miles. And of course there are the things everyone talks about that need no further comment: skilful plotting and incredible characters (Betsey Trotwood and Mr Dick being my favourites). And I loved realising midway through that this story was probably somewhat autobiographical.

I felt the Yarmouth/Emily storyline was a bit weaker than the others, but good nonetheless. Also, Copperfield bumps into old acquaintances a bit too frequently to be believable, but hey ho this is fiction. I thoroughly recommend Vance's audiobook, too. It can't have been easy with all those characters who each needed their own distinct voice, but he did a stellar job. C'est mon livre de chevet depuis que je suis enfant et je ne suis plus toute jeune ! Je le cherchais dans sa version originale je suis ravie de l'avoir enfin trouvé 😀"
Paradise Lost (AmazonClassics Edition),"In Paradise, God’s favored new creations—Adam and Eve—live in bliss, untainted by sin. In another realm, Satan and his banished rebel angels collude to destroy God’s tranquil new design. Into this idyll called Earth, and the confidence of Adam and Eve, Satan will instigate the fall of man.
At the heart of this complex, audacious epic poem is a drama driven by the most recognizable human flaws. More than a story from Genesis, it is the extraordinary expression of Milton’s search for personal truth and the meaning of existence, written to “justify the ways of God to men.”
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Paradise Lost, this edition of Paradise Lost (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Amazon has the bad habit of lumping reviews of multiple editions of a book without regard as to author/editor or publisher, to the detriment of the buyer's choosing an edition, so I write to make a few comments on the 984,562 editions of ""Paradise Lost"" listed for purchase. I have used the titles as listed by Amazon to help find the editions I refer to, and, with the exception of the books by Kastan, Lanzara, and BookCaps, the ones I discuss below are ones I own and am familiar with.

The version with an introduction and comments by Pullman has text that is large and readable, line numbers and some nice illustrations, taken from the first illustrated edition, published in 1688. It is a nice copy for those who want just the text of the poem. The text is based on Stephen Orgel's 2008 Paradise Lost (Oxford World's Classics) which has been modernized presumably with respect to capitalization, spelling and punctuation. The comments by Pullman are worthwhile, but, while he may be a very good writer, he is not a scholar of Milton. Unlike Orgel, there are no annotations or notes to explain Milton's often arcane language and allusions.

For readers seeking annotated versions, I suggest the following.

The ultimate edition of Milton is Alastair Fowler's : it has been called the Bible of Milton scholars; one review I saw called it suitable for graduate students majoring in Milton. It is one of the few available based on the first edition of ""Paradise Lost"", published in 1667, but Fowler states that it also includes the additions made in the second edition of 1674 --- the version that most of today's editors use. Know that Fowler has produced a very, very scholarly version with many, many notes, sometimes to the point that they leave only two or three lines of the poem on the page, so I strongly urge using the ""Look Inside"" feature before deciding to buy it. I recommend Fowler's 1998 edition in used paperback ---- reissued in 2006 with a new cover and much higher price.

The blurb from the publisher on the Pullman webpage misleads the reader by mentioning ""This is the first fully-annotated, old-spelling edition ..."" It ain't (as the small print says). I can't find the actual book this blurb refers to, there are several that might be the one mentioned. One such version, with very favorable recommendations, is Barbara K. Lewalski's 2007 that reproduces the original language, spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and italics of the 1674 text. Its annotations are on the same page. Again, I would again urge potential buyers to ""Look Inside."" (Incidentally, I was able to find a .pdf copy of it online).

Another annotated edition, again with those on the same page, that sticks close to the original 1674 text (but with some minor modernization) is Merritt Y. Hughes' , first published in 1935, and revised in 1962. It is advertised as one popular with college professors for their classes, whatever that may mean. From what I gather, Fowler has replaced Hughes as the scholarly version to use.

The edition by Hughes was taken in 2003 by David Scott Kastan () and edited more extensively, again with the annotations on the same page. Incidentally, Kastan's comments on how he edited, along with comments on any editor's choices when dealing with Milton, are well worth reading, and can be found under ""Textual Introduction"" using the ""Look Inside"" feature. I urge reading them to understand how and why there are so many different editions of Milton.

Yet another annotated edition that comes close to the original is by John Leonard's . The ad for this version states that the text has been modernized to the degree of reducing some capitals and italics, and correcting the spelling and some punctuation. It is annotated, but not to the degree of Fowler --- but the notes are at the back of the book rather than the bottom of the page as seems customary and which I personally find difficult to use because of constantly having to flip between pages. Again, I would urge potential buyers to ""Look Inside.""

There are many other scholarly editions available in addition to the ones I have mentioned here, including one online at the John Milton Reading Room at Dartmouth College.

For those who might like a less challenging version of ""Paradise Lost"", I suggest BookCaps ""translation"" (Amazon's words, not mine) or at an even less difficult level, Joseph Lanzara's . Should those prove too difficult, there might be somewhere a copy by Classics Illustrated comics, although a search by Google turns up nothing --- perhaps they never published one.

Since each edition of ""Paradise Lost"" has its strengths and weaknesses, how does the buyer go about selecting an edition for purchase? To me, it's rather like buying a car --- ultimately based upon personal preference, but in this case, rather than engine and body style, determined by the way the editor has modified Milton's language and added annotations, and their degree of adherence to his original language --- some editors produce as little modernization as possible to retain Milton's original meter and rhythm for reading aloud, while others try for a more modern sound. I would suggest using the ""Look Inside"" feature, to see what the editor has done, to help making a decision.

Whichever edition you buy ---- and I recommend the one by Lewalski ---- may you find great enjoyment in reading what I consider the greatest epic poem in the English language --- although you might agree more with what Donald Sutherland's character, Jennings, had to say about it in the movie ""Animal House"": ""Now what can we say about Milton's ""Paradise Lost""? It's a very long poem. It was written a long time ago, and I'm sure a lot of you have difficulty understanding exactly what Milton was trying to say. ..... Don't write this down, but I find Milton probably as boring as you find Milton. Mrs. Milton found him boring too. He's a little bit long-winded, he doesn't translate very well into our generation, and his jokes are terrible."" Regardless of edition, Paradise Lost is one of the finest books ever written, and possibly my favorite. While the subject matter is Christian, the book's greatness transcends religious categories, and I would recommend it equally to secular readers. It is uniformly spectacular in describing heaven, earth, and hell, angels and mortals. However the portrayal of Satan is particularly remarkable. At the start, though at his lowest point, he appears an idealistic hero - championing freedom and the power of the human/angelic mind against a more powerful oppressor. However, as it says in the beginning, his ""high words [bear] semblance of worth not substance."" As his situation improves, he's revealed as a hypocrite enslaved by his own pride, who increasingly disgusts even himself.

As others have pointed out, this is a beautiful edition of the book, well bound with big type. The Dore illustrations are a huge plus, and for me it's hard to imagine buying an edition without them. Blake's are the only real competition, and done in a very different style.

For the text, there are two issues that may be a challenge for first-time readers. One, as noted by others, there are no annotations. Honestly, vast sections of the book go by with nothing you'd want to look up anyway. A couple parts have tricky allusions (part of Book I comes to mind), but they're few enough to look up elsewhere, and Milton usually spends a couple lines giving you the gist of what he's referring to.

The second issue is spellings, which are modernized. While unneeded, this generally makes reading slightly easier without altering pronunciation. For ""ed"" endings, modern pronunciations (winged) are spelled normally, while the extra-syllable form (wing-ed) is indicated by a grave symbol. When ""the"" appears before a vowel, this edition doesn't specify whether to elide (as in, th'Aeonian mount). Hence you either have to infer based on the number of syllables (usually 10 per line) or simply ignore the issue. I was concerned at first, but upon reading it's barely an inconvenience at all. All or most of the other elisions remain explicit.

Overall, this is a superb edition, and perfect if you want a nice hardback containing the Dore illustrations. I found this cloth bound edition to be easier to read than the penguin paperback. The paper is thicker and the font is of higher quality. Lectura clásica es gratis y es buena. Deberían aprovechar y leer estos libros que marcan un hito en la escritura. Very nice book. The famous interpretation of Paradise Lost is that Satan is the hero with all the best lines. And there is a lot of validity in that. When he rebels in Heaven, taking with him a third of the angels, stricken by ""envie"" of the Son, he reveals himself as a thoughtful, interesting, innovative, brave character. But you can interpret Paradise Lost as a comparison of Satan and the Son. And the Son is presented as a kind, modest, thoughtful, innovative, brave character. He is kinder and softer than the humanised Son of the New Testament, and he softens the Father who immediately accepts his pleadings on behalf of mankind. The love that comes from the Son seems similar to me to the love which Popes, archbishops and cardinals refer to when they repeat the idea that ""God is love"". His love is immediate and merciful - not like the angry love of Jesus in the New Testament or the tough love of the Father. For instance, the Son is described as having a ""sense of new job ineffably diffused"" within him and of having ""Divine compassion"" which visibly appeared on him, and showing ""Love without end, and without measure Grace"". The Father also becomes deeply merciful, stating at one stage that either justice will survive or that man will - meaning that, if he wants man to survive, he must be merciful.
Another hero is Adam who also becomes thoughtful and brave as he becomes older and develops. Eve is tricky as she is painted as the traditional, beautiful wife who gets into terrible trouble when she uses her initiative (and eats the apple). The portrait of Eve is shocking, in fact. No wonder women were repressed by men when they read this or the Old Testament. She was blamed for everything and was untrustworthy and, under pressure, slippery. (At one stage she blames Adam for having listened to her entreaties to let her go off alone and, as it worked out, to be tempted by the serpent.)
Anyway, this is an astounding tale with wonderful characterisation, put together by someone with great imagination and great rationality. It is hard to read, however. Milton was a great linguist and his Latin style influences the construction of his sentences.
Just to quote a little on Satan. After ""the Arch-fiend lay/Chain'd on the burning lake"", having left Heaven, he has to work out what to do and how to organise Hell as far as he can. He says that ""The mind is its own place and in itself/Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n"". Later he tries to work out what doing evil means in practice, and so aims to create a system in which ""Fate shall yield/ To fickle Chance, and CHAOS judge the strife"". That is an interesting definition of Hell, in my view, and one that we do import to earth (in civil wars, extreme poverty and even in normal life).
This is ultimately a very optimistic work in many ways. For instance, the Angel Michael tells that fallen Adam that if he can feel love for others he ""shalt possess a Paradise within thee"" and that this could make him ""happier farr"" than just being in Paradise. Also, and this is easy to miss in the blandishments of the Testaments New and Old, man was created as a beautiful creature in the image of God. Adam and Eve seem ""Lords of all"" in Paradise. This is an amazing edition as well as an amazing read! Truly astonishing! I have been looking for a nice cover of this for a long time. I am very satisfied, beyond in fact! The story is great, the writing is marvelous. I get amazing visuals in my mind when I read this.... Fantastic. Very beautiful, both in appearance and in a literature sense. Highly recommended!"
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (AmazonClassics Edition),"Swept away by a cyclone from the Kansas prairies to the Land of Oz, Dorothy and her dog, Toto, must find their way home. Traveling to the Emerald City with a new band of friends—the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion—Dorothy’s fate is in the hands of a great and terrible wizard. But a wicked enemy stands in her way.
For readers familiar only with the iconic 1939 film, delightful surprises are in store along Baum’s original yellow brick road. Considered “America’s first fairy tale,” The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has found a home in the collective imagination of the entire world.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, this edition of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum, adapted by Eric Shanower, and illustrated by Skottie Young
Edition reviewed: Marvel hardcover edition, 2009.

Why I Picked it Up:
I actually wasn’t looking for a comic book at all. I wasn’t even looking at Wizard of Oz related things. I was reading a list of gift ideas for girls, and saw the Marvel version of the Wizard of Oz! Not to say that this is a girly book – it feels very gender neutral to me, which is probably one of the reasons that it was on the list. Anyway, I was intrigued, and looked it up. As soon as I saw the whimsical cover, and that it was a 200+ page hardcover collected the 8 comic book issues, I purchased it right away.

My Overall Opinion:
This book is not at all what I’m usually into. Perhaps I was inspired by Darth Vader and Son, which I found adorable. But this book absolutely blew me away.
Of course, I watched the Wizard of Oz movie starring Judy Garland as a kid. So I knew the basic storyline, but I hadn’t known that the movie had changed so much of the original book. To my delight (in my world, books > movies), this Marvel edition was a direct, visual transformation of the original.
Shanower does a great job of adapting the story. It’s easy to read, the plot is clear and concise, and the dialogue fits in perfectly. Another review states that this book is text heavy for a graphic novel. However, I didn’t notice this, so I assume this is only a problem for very young children. It seemed like a perfectly reasonable amount of text to me. I’d like to think that this book transcends all age groups.
But where this book really shines lies in the visual aspects. Artist Skottie Young and colorist Jean-Francois Beaulieu have made this book an absolute masterpiece. The art is truly wonderful, and the vibrant colors enhance the storyline more than I would have thought possible. I would buy this book just to stare all the beautiful artwork because it really is outstanding. I never knew how much colors could alter the tone of a scene, and Beaulieu is clearly an expert here. Young’s incredibly talented as well, and the bonus material in the back shows his character building process, with various sketches and prototypes. I really appreciated this section, because it really demonstrates Young’s versatility and creativity – I had no idea how much work it took to develop original artwork for characters that readers had already cast in their heads.

After reading this, the 1939 movie is no longer the “standard” Wizard of Oz tale to me. If I ever hear of the Cowardly Lion, Skottie Young’s illustration is the one that I will think of. I will think of silver shoes instead of ruby red shoes, and I will see the Tinman with a (awesome) moustache forever.
This book is timeless and beautiful, and I would highly recommend for anyone with even the slightest inkling of interest in the Wizard of Oz. I had enjoyed the Judy Garland movie, but it was never one of my favorites. This Marvel edition, however, is now a book that I will recommend to everyone with children. On top of that, this version is just as likeable for adults and teens!
So just hurry up and get a copy of this book. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is waiting! The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the 1900 children’s classic, was written by L. Frank Baum. It is a masterfully-written tale penned by this beloved American author. The book begins and ends in America’s heartland: Kansas.

But have we been cheated?

This highly-imaginative 1900 book was later followed by the film version in 1939, which is one of the most successful films ever made. From that point on, the film version began its journey to overtake the written medium. In fact, after the film was produced in BluRay many years later, the scarecrow’s face in the corn field, for example, showed the cross threads in the sackcloth for its head. Such clarity in film frames made watching this version of the film breathtakingly beautiful – and much more preferable to watching any of the other versions.

Unfortunately, for both children and adults, watching the film has supplanted even reading the book.

But there is more! In total, Baum wrote 14 Oz books! Some of these aren’t based in Kansas; Dorothy is an international globetrotter! (Read the 13 others to find out where she travels.)

Theosophist L. Frank Baum seemed to be ‘plugged into’ a realm of searching for deep themes of truth, tapped into by other international groups: the freemasons, many of the religions, metaphysics, all of whom trace their beginnings back to the Egyptian Mystery Schools. Our ancient philosophers, mathematicians, and others (Aristotle, Pythagorus, etc.) also passed through these portals.

* Eugene Whitworth has written a book for adults which examines similar themes and truths, Nine Faces of Christ.

What are some of the main themes in books from both authors, Baum and Whitworth?
1. STRONG MAN MADE OF METAL – a. Oz: The Tin Woodman/ b. *9 Faces: Man of Tin
2. DIRECTIONS – a. Oz: E & W (Wicked Witches) and N & S (Good Witches)/ b. *9 Faces: Mysteries of the Orient
3. NUMBERS – a. Oz: Dorothy clicking her heels 3X/ b. *9 Faces: # of imitations, genders, opposites, birth and death
4. FLYING/ ASTRO TRAVELLING – a. Oz: the 2 professor’s balloon flights/ b. *9 Faces: Soul Flight (and also the Hijra in Islam in 622 AD)

Whether for children or adults, both authors, though, have the same golden thread interwoven throughout their books.

Baum used a variety of pen names on his books: males, females, and a military captain! He did this so because in those days, he could write about certain topics from different viewpoints for social and political purposes. He was a writer, newspaper editor, film producer, and actor.

A wonderful next step to reading The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is to read the remaining 13 Oz books, to mine those books for main themes that tie into this book.

I highly recommend the following reading tactics: reading silently, reading to children, or having children read the Wonderful Wizard of Oz book to you. Some extensions to this book could be to then go through the remainder of the Oz series books with children. Have them: discuss main themes, draw pictures, create personal ‘books’ with the important parts both drawn and labelled in them, etc.

I highly recommend this wonderful book classic as a beginning Oz book for children to read or for an adult to read to children who cannot yet read.

(* Eugene Whitworth’s beautiful, deep, sensitive book Nine Faces of Christ is about the metaphysical Christ; it is written for the adult at a higher, more cognitively astute, complex, intellectual level. Like Oz for children, adults might want to read this book to identify the same golden thread interwoven throughout both of them. I highly recommend reading this book, too!) I enjoyed the book. I don't know if I like it better than the movie but it's definitely different than the movie. I would love to have the book as well as the printed illustrations . The genius of them was a rare example of Art and the magic of the story. I would like to thank all who were involved in this book. Amazon is the seller and shipper for this beautiful book. It is a hardback illustrated 100th Anniversary Books of Wonder Edition reprinting from a reputable publisher - Harper Collins - ISBN 0-06-029323-3, with smooth paper, slick full color plates and gilt page edges. It has a nice size font for young readers with two color drawings imbedded throughout the text in addition to the color plates. These are replicas of the original illustrations. Very happy with this lovely edition of the Wizard of Oz. This is the original book, and doesn't match the movie - like all books made into plays and movies - for those of you who have only seen the movie. Others have done the book report quite well, this fills the physical book itself. Now I just need to find the 14 matching volumes for the full set! Very happy with this book for my granddaughter's ""Life Library"". Acquistato per mia figlia. Prima media. Ottimo allenamento per l inglese. Schede per la comprensione del testo. Consigliato. Leven zonder angst en doen wat er gedaan kan worden. Vriendelijk zijn tegen iedereen, benieuwd zijn naar een ander.
En open staan voor alle mogelijkheden. Dat leerden ze je vroeger in kinderboeken. Hoe is dat eigenlijk tegenwoordig? まあ一つ一つの困難を結構簡単に乗り越えちゃうのですが
英語もわかりやすいし物語としても良く出来てると思います。
何となく知ってる話を英語でちゃんと読んでみたい人向け。
表現は平易です。 História simples, agradável e interessante até para um adulto. Não foi previsível. Recomendo o clássico para quem, assim como eu, está buscando fluência no inglês. A great read - certainly stood the test of time"
The Metamorphosis (AmazonClassics Edition),"One morning, traveling salesman Gregor Samsa wakes from an anxious dream to discover that he has inexplicably changed into a monstrous insect. Nonetheless, life goes on, and poor Gregor is left to deal not only with the existential questions of who or what he now is but also with more mundane concerns: his job (which he fears he’ll lose), his loved ones (whom he fears he disgusts), and the daily indignities of everyday life (which continue apace). Soon, even those who sympathize with his bizarre predicament begin to lose their patience…
A darkly comic examination of social mores, family dynamics, and the nature of identity itself, Kafka’s unsettling masterpiece has inspired a century of literary debate and interpretive theories. But its enduring power lies in the simplicity of its audacious premise, its deadpan surrealism, and its humane sensitivity.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Metamorphosis, this edition of The Metamorphosis (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. A strange, thought-provoking story about the realities of isolation and family alienation, told through the eyes of a bug. Classic Kafka and a must read. This is such a weird book but still very fascinating. I'm not quite sure why he chose a beetle but I do like the concept of how work has stripped him of his freedom. He cannot even be home sick supposedly without his boss showing up at his door to find out why he didn't come in. I'm also not a fan of how his family treats him. He spends an exorbitant amount of time and energy working to make sure they're taken care of but they do not respect or treat him kindly at all. I feel bad for him. He suddenly experiences this big change but no one is willing to help him adjust smoothly. This is the second time I've read it, and I enjoyed it even more the second run-through. I never did understand this book. We had to read it in my college German class and the translation matches what I remember of the original. I guess I'm not ""deep"" enough to appreciate such a work of literature. This book is surprisingly emotional and extremely well written for a story about a man who turns into a bug. Kafka manages to perfectly describe alienation and poverty and generational guilt and trauma through the eyes of a cockroach struggling even to move his legs. I listened to part of this book on Spotify and I was so enthralled by the weird as hell story that I didn’t hear the ambulance behind me. Weird weird weird. First time reading Kafka and I need a Tylenol right after. I still plan on reading some of his other works. Very interesting book. Not really friend breaking or thought provoking, but an interesting look at his society treats its castaways. Kafka is truly brilliant, his ability to construct such a powerful contrast and composition; building anxiety then maybe releasing it only to build the anxiety further for and against Gregor, the protagonist undergoing the horrific metaphorical experience, for and against Gregors mother, father, little sister, a crew of housekeepers, cook and later three bizarre lodgers. All of these characters play a crudely existential part in this strange struggle of survival. Great story of how a family can become so dependent on one member's financial contributions until he is no more... It is a great reminder of our life what we think is precious and we lay our life for the family and others when we turn into something where we are no longer useful we just become burden for them and they want to get rid of us as soon as possible and start their new life. Beautifully described by Kafka es ist ein gut geschriebenes buch, doch schwer die nachricht dahinter zu verstehen. trotzdem würde ich es als ein klassiker weiterempfehlen This story was a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon. It had a great early magical realism theme, and kept me spellbound. kafka in this work keeps you on your tip toes till the very end. Simply amusing and ecstatic. Would recommend this book to all A most unusual story, but fascinating. Gregor's nightmare upon waking is an oddly compelling story. His families reaction to his plight goes from horror to concern, then tolerance, then hatred. You can see where the term 'Kafkaesque' comes from. A good book."
Heidi (AmazonClassics Edition),"Filled with the power of love and the beauty of nature, Heidi is a lyrical tale about a little girl sent to live in the mountains of the Swiss Alps with her grandfather. A grumpy recluse, her grandfather has isolated himself from his fellow townspeople and his church. In very little time, Heidi warms his heart; and she quickly charms the whole town and makes new friends, including young Peter, the goatherd. But when Heidi is sent away again to care for a young girl her own age, she must grow wise beyond her years, learning invaluable lessons that she will impart to others to better their lives.
In her best-known book, Johanna Spyri portrays how a child’s radiant joy and simple faith can transform the world around her.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Heidi, this edition of Heidi (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. We purchased this book in order my daughter to read and write a book report about the virtues and Christian-values through her Catholic Home School program. We chose this copy of the book because it was original and unabridged. Both my daughter and I read the book and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is so superbly well-written, with bits of anticipation and humor along the way. Heidi is about an orphaned girl in Switzerland, whose aunt took care of her until she obtained a better job, and decided it was Heidi's grandfather's turn to keep her. Heidi's grandfather lived up the mountain in a bit of remote area, with the town of Dorfli a trek away. Heidi meets Peter and his mother and grandmother and spends time with Peter, taking the goats to pasture. Heidi's aunt decided to later take her from the grandfather, who came to love her, to be come a companion to an ""invalid"" girl, Clara, in Frankfurt. Although Heidi is younger than Clara, Clara delights in the funny and inspiring things that Heidi says and does, and they become good friends. Heidi suffered terribly as she missed Grandfather and her life in the mountains, but came to know those in Clara's life, including her grandmother, who taught her to have hope and keep praying to God, and the kind, good-hearted doctor who took care of Clara. Heidi's simplicity, and the way she looked at life, made her long the matched simplicity of the mountains and life with Grandfather. No spoilers here, but good things happen in the story! The characters are very well-defined, and Heidi touches the hearts of all who meet her. If you have seen any versions of Heidi in movie form, you are missing a lot from the book. As much as I like Shirley Temple, the producers of the version she starred in did a disservice to original Heidi book -- it is like looking at a whole different movie. (Disney later came out with a much closer account of the Heidi book as a movie in later years.) Everyone who reads Heidi will enjoy it and walk away with something that touches them -- something to recall and remember as their favorite part of the book. I love Heidi - the book and most film or TV adaptations of it. The story is so wholesome and nothing quite makes me want to visit Switzerland one day than this book. Such sweet reminders that simple living can be the best and the importance of education, whether from formal training in a classroom or from experienced elders on a mountainside. Sprinkled throughout with words of wisdom about the goodness of God and how much He cares for His creation. Even if one is not religious, you can still appreciate the morals doing within this impeccably crafted story. We are enjoying this book very much! I purchased it for our read aloud portion of our homeschool lessons and my girls are begging me to continue reading each day and even asking for it as a bedtime story! This is my first time reading it (somehow) and I find it to be very entertaining also and a very touching story. It is a great example for my girls to learn more about trusting God’s plans and his timing. We love this book! I read it to my kids as they fall asleep.

Here are the professional reviews:
Amazon.com Review
Johanna Spyri's classic story of a young orphan sent to live with her grumpy grandfather in the Swiss Alps is retold in it's entirety in this beautifully bound hardcover edition. Heidi has charmed and intrigued readers since it's original publication in 1880. Much more than a children's story, the narrative is also a lesson on the precarious nature of freedom, a luxury too often taken for granted. Heidi almost loses her liberty as she is ripped away from the tranquility of the mountains to tend to a sick cousin in the city. Happily, all's well that ends well, and the reader is left with only warm, fuzzy thoughts. Spryi's story will never grow wearisome--and this is a very appealing edition. --Naomi Gesinger --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.

From Publishers Weekly
This truncated retelling of orphan Heidi's simple life in the Swiss Alps and her sojourn in the big city seems almost as indebted to the Shirley Temple film as to Johanna Spyri's 1880 novel. Krupinski's (A New England Scrapbook) heroine mimics Temple, curls, button nose and all, though she lacks the actress's expressive smile and gestures. Similarly blank-faced characters contrast with Krupinski's serene, lushly idealized landscape paintings: the people seem like wax dolls, but the glowing blankets of flowers make the Alps heaven on earth. The text emphasizes the sensual joys of fresh goat's milk, fir trees ""with their piney scent,"" Heidi's sweet-smelling bed in her grandfather's hay loft, etc., but that is its only demonstrable strength. Both Heidi's relationship with her grandfather and the idealized subplot about wheelchair-bound Klara's learning to walk are woodenly described; little space is given to dialogue and even less to Heidi's emotions. The plot, too, is severely condensed: ""Many more good things happened after that day."" The book succeeds as a portrayal of the joys of mountain life, but otherwise fails to do justice to Spyri's story of a girl's courage and persistence. Ages 5-9.

I agree with both of those reviews. Reconciliation…what a beautiful concept. This thread runs throughout the story of Heidi. Hope …who can fully exist without it? Each of the characters finds, extends, or withdraws it to his or her own detriment. This is another thread running throughout the story. Joy…when desires are granted and wrongs made right is the third thread running throughout the book.I was totally taken with the story and observed how the threads were woven together to make a grand tapestry of this God-honoring story. I think this book is best suited for mid to upper elementary. This story teaches us that kindness, caring, and sincerity can make a big impact on the people around us. It also gives a message to belief in God. God has given us the best gift which is our lives and we must be grateful for that. Frankly, we are no one to judge a classic; they are called classics for a reason.

This was a pleasant, heart-warming and a feel-good read. Heidi ist ein zeitloses sehr gut geschriebenes Kinderbuch. Es ist genauso aktuell, als zur der Zeit es war, als es geschrieben wurde.
Ich habe dieses Buch als Kind gerbne geledsen uind auch meine Kinder hatten viel Freude danmit Item arrived in great condition!! Happy with purchase :) I got this in the mail today and got pretty disappointed, this book is pretty big, thin and the text is very small, I don’t even want to read it because I know I’ll get a head ache and I’m definitely returning this product. I love how everything was perfect in the end, and the characters are so great to read about. The story is amazing and it’s a favourite children’s classic! I read this as a kid and it is still a joy to read."
Romeo and Juliet (AmazonClassics Edition),"When the feud between the Montagues and Capulets spills into the streets of Verona, a great love must be kept secret—that of Romeo, son of Montague, and Juliet, daughter of the sworn enemy. But only a tragic twist of fate can promise peace.
When Shakespeare staged Romeo and Juliet in 1594, it was already a centuries-old Italian tale that had been translated and adapted in verse and prose by a number of poets and storytellers. Out of the common threads of those now-forgotten works, Shakespeare created not only one of his most popular plays, but one that would become the archetypal love story of the English language.
Revised edition: Previously published as Romeo and Juliet, this edition of Romeo and Juliet (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Film, comic TV series adaptations multiply the story of Romeo and Juliet. I have enjoyed many of its mirrors as the version with Leonardo DiCaprio in Miami, the kung fu version with Jet Li, the black and white classic with Cantinflas (""London! I mean... Paris!""xD), or Juleo and Rumiet by Chespirito, among many others. But just now I dared to read the original and it was jaw-dropping...

Shakespeare is invisible. He creates a world where he is not seen and all is doomed to fit or crash by its own accord. The first scenes indirectly set the following drama. In a world where Romeo and Juliet are not meant to be, they violently and inevitably fall in love with each other. There is Rosaline, whom Romeo loved with juvenile passion to her idealized shape. She is there and she is not there to make a contrast with the feelings toward Juliet. Juliet for her part has to clad her tears of love with the disguise of mourning for her cousin Tybalt; she utters words of revenge against Romeo because the world is against her love. Similar to the end of Don Quixote, when he awakes from madness to the tiredness of reality, Romeo also, at his end, has no romance but solitary longing; one that awakes him into a conscious lucidity of his ""world-weary flesh"" of man. The moment in which he is alone with himself after losing everything at hands of death... is not Hamlet that descends into madness, is Romeo that now seems to understand everything. Rather than romance Romeo and Juliet is about the struggle of small humanity against destiny, to do anything despite to have the whole universe plotting against you. As so this story is a triumph.

Borges said that secretly the national book of Englishmen is the bible, not Shakespeare's works; and that Shakespeare's works was secretly the national book of Germany, not Goethe's works. I love so much the diverse authors of the United Kingdom, especially those at the end of 19th century and beginning of 20th century. But I have to concord that Shakespeare seems different. Clearly universal, not for the location of his plays, but because the human nature is common to each man and woman; a quality that Romanticism, in its insistence for exotic objects to clad the fellow citizens instead to get to to the heart of the exotic cultures, failed to accomplish (although in fairness perhaps that wasn't its goal). Maybe indeed Shakespeare is more akin to the Germanic and Nordic old sagas, those that have a wise understanding of men and women, with characters that deeply say far more in their actions or in subtle words.

About the AmazonClassics Edition it has a minimal of X-Ray to indicate the allegiance of each character to the Capulet or Montague families. Beyond that there are not footnotes nor prologues; and I am happy for that because Shakespeare is better discovered without intermediaries. If you are a student or new to the works of Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare Made Clear) is a handy, must have guide for understanding this great work of literature. The book not only lists modern language next to the original language, it also provides in depth historical information about the play, act-by-act synopses of the play, a cast of characters, the play's major themes, and a section on Shakespeare himself.

This guide literally ""translates"" Shakespeare into modern language that is readily understood by today's audience. Jokes, proverbs, contextual insights, and historical and religious explanations of the original language are also conveniently provided in footnotes below the passages.

For example, Romeo says, ""But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun."" The modern interpretation of that phrase is, ""But wait--what light do I see in the window? It is the east, and Juliet is like the sun."" The footnote text further explains: ""This scene, like others in the play, contains imagery of light and darkness. For example, Romeo stands in the shadows of Juliet's balcony, and he compares her first to the sun and then to the brightness of the stars in the night sky.""

Organized in a manner that presents the original passages first, followed by the modernized passages, and the explanatory footnotes, it's an easy read that will expand your knowledge and enjoyment of the Great Bard. Till now, I had always found Shakespeare's language so daunting that after a while I gave up on reading him. Thanks to the Barnes&Noble editions, this has changed for me. First of all, they have an outstanding introductory essay where I read for the first time that Shakespeare's language is difficult for everybody and why. The realization that the problem was not just me gave me the courage to persevere. But for me the main advantage of these editions is that I get just the right amount of help with Shakespeare's language, without being overburdened with extra information that might be interesting but slows me down and makes me lose interest (e.g. the Arden Shakespeare editions). Especially helpful is that the explanations are split into two. Just beside the text are the translations of archaic words or ""false friends"", words we know but that were used with a different meaning in Shakespeare's time, such as ""jealous"". In other editions you are forced to search somewhere far away for these explanations and the editors wrongly assume that explaining such words once is enough (a seemingly minor issue which can become extremely frustrating). On the opposite page of Barnes&Noble Shakespeare more complicated expressions are explained, such as allusions to things we are no longer familiar with or cleverly crafted poetic phrases that probably would have caused Shakespeare's contemporaries difficulties too. Somehow, I found it much easier and faster to look for these explanations on the side rather than at the bottom. I was also agreeably surprised by the cheapness of these Barnes&Noble editions, I don't know how to manage to make money on them. My only disappointment is that they have not brought out the whole Shakespeare yet, I sincerely hope they will. Adaptação boa, mas não é original. Good quality for price - just needed something I could write in for teaching R&J! Wouldn't recommend this addition for student use as it doesn't come with helpful side notes/explanations, but for my purposes this was great. Wer kennt sie nicht, die Geschichte von Romeo und Julia? Vor über 500 Jahren schrieb William Shakespeare diese Liebesgeschichte die eigentlich eine Tragödie ist. Bis zum heutigen Tag ist die Geschichte brandaktuell, wurde unzählige Male verfilmt und ist bis heute eines der klassischen Stücke auf den Theaterbühnen weltweit.

Dank des Projekts Gutenberg und Amazon Kindle sind viele Klassiker nun endlich einem viel breiteren Publikum zugänglich. Scheuten sich früher viele Leser, für so ""alte Schinken"" Geld auszugeben, so gibt es nun keine Ausreden mehr. Trotzdem sollten Klassiker wie dieser nicht in einer gut sortierten Familienbibliothek fehlen. Auch in der Schule (Gymnasium) wird Romeo and Juliet heute noch gerne als Klassenlektüre genommen.
Die hier vorliegende Version ist eine gut lesbare, einfach verständliche Englische Version. Perfekt geeignet für ungeübte Leser, die den Klassiker trotzdem in Originalsprache geniessen wollen, oder für Schüler im Englischunterricht, die wohl sehr Mühe hätten den Schreibstil und die Wortwahl des Originals zu verstehen. Sowohl bei mir als auch bei meiner Mutter wurde Romeo and Juliet im Unterricht gelesen. Die Geschichte ist immer noch brandaktuell und sehr lehrreich. Was damals Familienfehden waren, sind heute Gang-Kriege. Hass und Verspottung heissen heute Mobbing und dass Familien gegen Beziehungen/Heirat/Zusammenleben sind, findet man auch heute noch in vielen Kulturkreisen der Erde.
Als eines meiner Lieblingstheaterstücke gebe ich Romeo and Julia 5 Sterne. Absolut lesenswert!

SPOILER:

Die Geschichte spielt in der norditalienischen Stadt Verona. Die Familien Capulet und Montague sind Feinde und es kommt ständig zu Streit, blutigen Auseinandersetzungen und Kämpfen. Da ist es natürlich denkbar ungünstig, dass Julia Capulet und Romeo Montague sich ineinander verliebt haben! Sie müssen ihre Liebe geheim halten, da sie Angst haben, dass die verfeindeten Familien sich gegenseitig umbringen. In ihrer Verzweiflung lassen sich die beiden später von einem Pater namens Lorenzo trauen und hoffen, dass durch die heimliche Eheschliessung endlich das Kriegsbeil begraben wird.
Leider geht ihr Plan nicht auf, zwischen Julias Cousin Tybalt und Romeo entbrennt ein heftiger Kampf und am Ende stirbt Tybalt. Der Tod Tybalts hat verheerende Konsequenzen: Wegen dem hohen Risiko, dass er von Julias Angehörigen verfolgt und ermordet wird, muss Romeo aus Verona fliehen. Auch seine eigene Familie kann ihn nicht schützen und so zieht er weiter nach Mantua.
Sobald Romeo weg ist, wollen die Capulets ihre Tochter Julia gegen deren Willen mit Paris, einem Bekannten der Familie, verheiraten. Um ihrer Familie einen Strich durch die Rechnung zu machen und die Zwangsheirat zu verhindern, schmiedet Julia zusammen mit Pater Lorenzo einen Plan: Sie trinkt einen Schlaftrunk, der sie während 42 Stunden lähmt, bewusstlos macht und sie wie tot erscheinen lässt. Zur selben Zeit soll Romeo darüber in einem Brief berichtet werden, jedoch erhält er den Brief leider nicht wegen einem Missgeschick. Daraufhin berichtet ihm einer seiner Freunde fälschlicherweise von Julias Tod, unwissend dass diese lediglich durch den Schlaftrunk bewusstlos ist.
Sofort lässt Romeo alles stehen und liegen, reist trotz der Gefahr, von den Capulets ermordet zu werden, nach Verona. Er will mit eigenen Augen sehen, wie Julia in der Gruft der Capulets beigesetzt wird. Als er sie mit eigenen Augen sieht und Julia für tot hält, schluckt Romeo Gift damit er an Julias Seite stirbt und dann wenigstens im Tod mit ihr zusammen sein kann. Kurze Zeit später sind die 42 Stunden um und Julia erwacht aus ihrem Schlaf. Entsetzt muss sie leider feststellen, dass ihr Plan nicht funktioniert hat. Der tote Romeo liegt neben ihr. Schockiert und aller Lebensfreude beraubt, greift Julia nach dem Dolch ihres Geliebten und nimmt sich ebenfalls das Leben.
Als die beiden verfeindeten Familien Capulet und Montague begreifen, was für eine grosse Tragödie passiert ist weil sie Zeugen des Unglücks waren, begreifen sie endlich die Tragweite und die Konsequenzen ihrer so lange andauernden Familienfehde und des gegenseitigen Hasses. Sie beschliessen, sich zu versöhnen damit die Familien in Zukunft friedlich nebeneinander leben können und nie wieder so etwas schreckliches passiert. Rien de grave à dire sur le livre de Shakespeare dans Roméo et Juliet. Merveilleux comme prévu et une belle couverture par-dessus. J'adore cette pièce et le livre est magnifique.

The Republic (AmazonClassics Edition),"What is justice? In Plato’s Socratic dialogue, The Republic, the citizens of ancient Greece explore the world’s most fundamental question.
In search of an ideal civilization, Socrates leads Glaucon, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus, and others in debates about various subjects, including justice, truth, class, and art. For without righteousness, tyranny and injustice give rise to oligarchy.
The influential dialogues of The Republic helped shape all of Western literature and philosophical thought. It is as much a doctrine of ethics and politics now as it was for the ancient Greeks, and its dilemma remains: how to create a perfect society populated by very imperfect human beings.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Republic, this edition of The Republic (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Yes, this edition has a long intro, but that intro is an argument by argument exegesis (explanation) of Plato's Republic with
extensive quotes and commentary that lay clear its virtues and its flaws as seen from a modern perspective.

The Republic is Plato's ideal society, but mustn't an ideal society be based on Justice? So first before we can realize an
ideal society, we must achieve justice (or an understanding of it). This is where Plato starts.

Socrates, acting as Plato's mouthpiece, asks, ""What is Justice."" Each guest answers starting with the host who gives the
weakest but most obvious answer: Justice is doing good to your friends and evil to your enemies. Socrates examines and dismantels each argument as they are presented. What if the person you think is a friend is not your friend? What if you friend lends you a gun - he then goes crazy and asks for the gun back. The arguments get stronger in succession till Mr. T. proposes that ""Might makes right."" The tyrant makes justice synonymous with their interests: I am the state and your country right or wrong.

On the question of whether justice = happiness: (from the commentary),

Let a man do his duty first without asking whether he will be happy or not, happiness will
be the inseparable accident which attends him. 'Seek ye first the kingdom of god and
and his righteousness, and all thes things shall be added unto you.'

Is the just person happy on the rack? Well, maybe not.

If you wish to pay for a version with a nice index, feel free, but one of the other reveiws provides the chapter index location numbers. Now I admit I've only read to location 600, but when i've tried to read the Republic on my own it was
somewhat perplexing. For those genuses who only need Einsten's equations to feret out the meaning of relativity the intro
is superfluous, but to those like me whose intellignece is 'Shockingly limited' I recommend this edition, and the price is
right. BTW I paid $$ for a Philosophy 101 course where this book was all we read and professor's lectures were substantially what is in this intro.

Mike the K I teach the Republic to High School students and have been using the translation by Griffith (Cambridge) for many years. For reasons I don't recall, I have thought Jowett's translation unreliable and so have avoided it. On a lark, I decided to reread The Republic in Jowett's translation and found it fantastic. I am not qualified to judge its accuracy of translation, as I only know the smallest amount of Greek. But, even though I have read this marvelous dialog many times, I felt that I was understanding some of the content in ways I had not previously experienced. I will continue to teach from Griffith, as its scholarly reputation is solid, but I will not be shy of reading Jowett's version in the future - neither his version of The Republic or other of Plato's dialogs. I always wondered if Plato’s Republic, reflecting Socrates’ reason, was the first book ever written in logic and rational thinking.
The platonic way of conversation, the ancient dialogue between two, started during the ancient Greeks and entails building conclusions one after the other and one leading to the other in small logical and reasonable steps, and the second person just agrees because it is so logical and philosophically true to deny.
“The Republic” logically identifies all aspects to build a strong good just educated person, government, and republic.

4* For both the simplistic and logical way of writing, the philosophy of Plato’s cave, and the birth of the logical philosophy or the “philosophy of logic.”

amirgendy.com There are no lables for truth. However, the civilization we live in try to tell us that man's civilization is only 6 thousand yrs old & man 10 thousand. Da, not so! This is why they have gnosticism. Because how if man is only six thousand years old, do they have Solon Hermes, Pythagoras, Socraest, Plato, Aristoles, Hippocratics the physcian, just came out knowing all and more than the Doctors of the eary 20th centry. When it comes to Greek Myyhology shows the mistakes in history. After the Dark age know one knew how to read unless they where Royal bloodlines and yet not even, Constantine who was only the Emperor of the East of the Roman Empire and the west had fallen Burn the great library of Alexandria that was made to collect lost knowledge After the Myology of man & war of the Gods. It was a place that was a city of study we will never have such truth,! When Julis Ceaser burnd it and said how could one man conquer the world by 32 years and in the year 48 BC means that he must have at least been in his 50s which was old then. He said the only way to conquer the world was through igorence. Strip them of their knowledge and the truth of man. The 3rd Century Ad to push ignorence & muder those.Created by PtolemyI Soter who was a Macedonian General under Alexander THE GREAT! most Books were kept inPapyrus scrolls Unknowing how many books were taken out at a time 40,000 to 4000.000, at its height!Being burned down from the bloodlines that still rule the world today but mixed with the once Celts meaning the cent land. Name changed after general Germanius as lands to conquer! This burn threw the world into ignorence except the Romans & Hellenistic, = the Semetic taht went to the Creed of Nicien Council of Nicea 325 almost the same time as the Burning that lost all oneness of man. Constantine odered all priest of all belifes to rewrite the history of man, the book of Enoch was of part of Genesis, it spoke of man being very advanced and the war of man and the Gods. ????? Then they murdered all the advanced people and knowledge like Nikola Tesla had to be past down by word of mouth. I love Greek ""Mythology, it should becalled lost facts. Pomei was a myth so was troy, now facts. thank the Greeks for holding this great knowledge, Egyptians are just like the rest even though Thoth who is Hermes tought them 古くて新しい共和国。一読の要あると思うが、かなりの基礎教養ないとわけ分からん。ごめんなさい。 There’s a reason the Socratic method is used for teaching in American law schools. It fosters rational analysis. Of course, it doesn’t always take. Lol The Republic is one of the most influential books of human history. It forms not just the basis of individual rights and responsibilities, but also, through its method of examination, sets out the structure of contemporary governance of states. The premise of the Republic is an examination of whether it is better to be just or unjust, which at the time, and even now, is not a given. Plato uses the state as a vehicle to examine the advantage of one over the other. Many different human constructions have claimed the legitimacy of their cause through their interpretation of the Republic. Hitler and the Nazi's used the examination of the virtuous state to justify their view, whilst most modern leaders also refer to its supporting theirs. It is therefore a devilishly difficult book to truly understand because of the sheer breadth of topics and issues that Plato introduces over the course of the dialogue. Readers must make sense not only of those issues in their own right but they must also understand them in relation to the larger themes and arguments of the work.  

For me the true value of the Republic is found in Books Five and Eight. In Five we see an analogous treatment of character or what Plato calls the soul. According to Plato the soul has three functions that correspond to the three parts of the soul: to rule oneself, to defend oneself, and to provide for one's bodily needs. Two virtues -- wisdom and courage -- follow directly from the functions of ruling and defending oneself. The other two virtues -- temperance and justice -- are holistic and enable the soul to perform all of its functions well. Plato uses the different functions that we would find in a city or state to demonstrate his point. What appealed to the Nazi's was Plato's focus on what we now call eugenics to make his point. He correctly states that each of us have a particular function, and service to the state. He states that only a very few have the capacity to rule a city or state, but not by birth, but rather through education and self-control. He therefore makes it clear that being born in a particular segment of society does not make a person just or virtuous, but rather their ability to rule themselves (porten sui). 

In Book Eight Plato examines the natures of different forms of government, and the nature of people that make up those governments (states). His examination of democracy is cutting, with thoughts such as ""he grandly does democracy trample all the fine notions of virtue... and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the people's friend (think Trump, populism). Further, ""These and other characteristics are proper to democracy, which is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike."" And then he outlines what the individual in a democracy looks like ""If any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions of good and noble desires, and others of evil desires, and that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others, whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike, and that one is as good as another."" This is what we now term equality, not understanding that things are not equal, but rather that some things are good and some are bad, saying that all things are equal and must be respected. ""And above all, see how sensitive the citizens become, they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority, and at length they cease to care even for the laws, written or unwritten, they will have no one over them"". ""And so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty.""

It is uncanny how Plato knew, in 325bc, what our democracies would look like, and what type of leader would arise. What is really frightening though is that he identifies that the next stage after democracy is tyranny. 

It is a very difficult book to fully understand, or in some cases to agree with, and I don't claim that I do, but there is much for us to learn from the attempt. The Republic by Plato is a foundational work in Western philosophy that explores the nature of justice, the ideal society, and the philosopher's role within it. Plato envisions an ideal city-state governed by philosopher-kings, where people are divided into three classes: rulers, warriors, and producers. Each class has a specific role, and justice is achieved when each performs its function without interference. The work also introduces the allegory of the cave, which illustrates the difference between the world of appearances and the world of true knowledge. I have only read 'Book I' and already I feel that I've got my money's worth! The pace of the dialogues between the characters is excellent, with short, concise answers intersecting pertinent, hypothetical questions. Socrates, in particular, reminds me of one of those sarcastic, know it all people but tolerated because of their charm, intelligence and sardonic wit. You get a real sense that Plato has given us the true Socrates which lends great weight to the realism of the scene. You could, albeit the antiquated prose, put this into a modern setting; down the local pub, family barbeque, or even a prison yard! This was a pleasant suprise as I was under the impression that it was just about the subject matter, which of course, it is fundamentally but even so, Plato could have probably wrote a good story about anything.
I'm no philosophy expert(really!!) and was drawn to the book after reading the allegory of the cave which is also worth the price of the book on it's own. If you haven't read the allegory, I suggest you look it up because I promise it will enlighten you but be warned, it might even blow your mind!!
I purposely haven't mentioned the subject matter because, like I said, I've only read the first book and just wanted to emphasize the fact that if you're studying philosophy, why are you reading this? You should already have it! If you are looking for a humorous and enlightening read, then this is for you. The style of writing does take getting used to but I don't think it's as confusing as Shakespeare. Looking forward to the next nine chapters."

Revised edition: Previously published as Anne of Green Gables, this edition of Anne of Green Gables (AmazonClassics Edition) Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery

First book in the Anne of Green Gables series

5 stars

Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert were hoping that the boy from the orphanage would be a big help around Green Gables, but they are in for a big surprise when Matthew finds Anne Shirley. A red-headed girl with a pension for speaking in flowery prose, dreaming big, and talking whenever she feels like it. Matthew is taken aback because he isn’t comfortable around the opposite sex and Marilla is a strict and stern woman who adheres to rules and reason. Anne slowly melts their hearts and finds her home in Green Gables all the while causing trouble, making friends, and experiencing new adventures. I remember when I first started listening to this audiobook. I wasn’t expecting much or exactly sure what to expect for the story of Anne of Green Gables. I had seen it mentioned every now and then around the blogosphere as a childhood favorite among readers, but I had never personally heard of Anne until I was sixteen and I expected that because I’m older it would be hard to read about such a young girl. That isn’t the case. This story is transcendent. Anne is character not like any other and the interesting thing about this novel is that it is told in third person and there is broad cast of characters to give outlook onto Anne.

The writing in this novel is beautiful. The way Montgomery writes is carefree, light, and fun. She makes Green Gables feel real and the characters feel like real people that I could’ve had tea with. I loved the time hops that were involved in the pacing. It paved Anne’s story out nicely and didn’t go through continuous everyday things.

Whimsical Writing Scale: 5

The main female character of this novel is Anne. Anne is an enduring character. She has a lot of deep thoughts for girl who is such a “kindred spirit”. I truly adore her narration and feel that she is a character that is just easy to instantly love. If I knew Anne personally she would probably be one of my favorite people because there is never a dull moment with her around. Anne is also a bit a trouble maker, but not intentional. She’s always getting into shenanigans in the oddest little ways, but I think that’s what makes Anne so much fun. She is a kid, but also she has the heart of a growing young adult and it can get Anne caught up in situations that she wouldn’t have expected to be in. Anne as a young adult is also one of my favorite things because it’s so amazing to see the metamorphosis from gangly, awkward girl with knobby knees and a loud mouth who takes no BS to a woman who fights for her goals and aspirations with confidence.

Kick-Butt Heroine Scale: 5

The main male character is Gilbert. Gilbert and Anne do not get off to a good start. In fact, she absolutely hates him while it’s obvious that Gilbert has a crush on her. It’s just so cute. As they grow older and experience life’s hardships, their interaction becomes difference and once they reached a truce and become friends my heart soared and I was ready to plan a wedding. Seriously, I just adore the development of this relationship and it brings a smile to my face.

Swoon Worthy Scale: 5

The Family Dynamic- Marilla and Matthew have a good sibling bond and as they begin to raise Anne, it becomes obvious who has the upper hand. Marilla is a stern woman, but she is an amazing mother figure to Anne and by the end of this novel I absolutely adored her. Matthew is awkward and clumsy at times, but he has a sweet connection with Anne and it’s obvious that she has stolen his heart. While Anne and Matthew aren’t Anne’s parents the dynamic that they bring into her life fill any holes she didn’t have growing up.

Character Scale: 5

The ending to this novel slowly ripped my hearts to pieces. When I listened to emotional scenes on audiobooks I become a blubbering mess. I definitely became a mess, but I also felt hopeful about where Anne’s life could go. There is no question that I’m going to continue on with this series. Mainly because I NEED to know how Anne and Gilbert get together. They are just so cute and I love them. I have since bought a box set of this series on my Kindle and will be rereading Anne of Green Gables this year because I LOVE it and want to feel happy innocent joy again.

Plotastic Scale: 5

Cover Thoughts: My cover of Anne doesn’t do justice, but I love the simplicity of it. I’m also planning to buy pretty editions for my book shelves because I need them in my life. In 1985 when I stumbled upon Kevin Sullivan's wonderful production of ""Anne of Green Gables"" with Megan Follows as Anne, Colleen Dewhurst as Marilla, and Richard Farnsworth as Mathew, it was my introduction to the Lucy Maud Montgomery's red-headed orphan. Like millions of others, I fell in love with the production and then proceeded to read this novel, the other seven books in the Anne Series, and then ""The Chronicles of Avonlea,"" ""The Story Girl,"" the ""Jane of Lantern Hill"" books, and every other thing written by Montgomery that I could get my hands on (and this was before all of those paperback collections of Montgomery's short stories were published).

In 1904 Montgomery had written down an idea for a story in her notebook: ""Elderly couple apply to orphan asylum for a boy. By mistake a girl is sent them."" In what must be heartening for many would be authors, Montgomery's manuscript for ""Anne of Green Gables"" was rejected repeated by publishers before it was finally accepted. The book was a bestseller from the moment it was published in June 1908 (I have a 19th impression printed in September 1910), although a critic in ""The New York Times"" complained that, ""there is no real difference between the girl at the end of the story and the one at the beginning of it."" Readers of the book would quite happy with that fact, because the reason we love this story is not that the talkative, red-haired orphan girl with her big green-grey eyes changes during the story, but that Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert, the elderly sister and brother who wanted to adopt a boy and got a girl instead, have changed profoundly.

Mark Twain described Anne Shirley as ""The dearest and most moving and delightful child since the immortal Alice,"" and nobody has been able to top that statement. Supposedly Montgomery's description of her famous literary creation was based on a photography of Evelyn Nesbit, the notorious American beauty who was the mistress whose husband, Harry K. Thaw, shot and killed her love, Stanford White, in the first scandalous murder trial of the 20th century. I suppose there is something archetypal about stories about orphans, that allows young readers to identify with such characters and explains why generations of children have responded to such stories. But what sets Montgomery's creation apart is her ability to provide of laughter and tears, what with her vivid imagination and her great desire to be loved. You laugh over Anne's over wrought apology to Mrs. Rachel Lynde and how her introduction to Gilbert Blythe ends with her breaking a slate over his head. But then there are the wonderfully touching scenes when Marilla apologizes for refusing to believe Anne about her broach, when Mathew goes to town to get Anne a dress with puffed sleeves, and when the Reaper whose name is Death comes to visit Green Gables. There are just so many wonderful moments in this novel, which is the best in the series. When you read the rest of the books in the series, this is the one you will keep coming back to again and again to read once more your favorite parts (I just did).

I have two daughters and despite my best intentions I have never been able to persuade them to read ""Anne of Green Gables."" But given how long it took me to get around to them they still have at least a decade to beat me to the punch in relative terms, and I have the Sullivan productions on DVD so that I can use the same hook that worked so well one me. Once they do I am sure they will be just as captivated by all of the others who love the Anne-Girl and who have traveled to Prince Edward Island to see all of the sites that Montgomery translated into the world of Anne Shirley.

My favorite memory is when we went to ""Green Gables."" You go in through the front door and follow the way around the first floor and then up the stairs to the second floor. As I was at the bottom of those stairs the young woman watching the door had momentarily stopped the line entering the site. In this case that person who had to wait was a young Japanese girl, who looked to be about eight years old, and who was shivering in delight at the fact that she was standing on the threshold of Anne Shirley's Green Gables. That is how beloved Lucy Maud Montgomery's creation is almost a century after she was first set down on paper. Love my new copy! La editorial lanzó esta colección de libros de tamaño bolsillo (o hasta un poco más pequeños), de pasta dura con cubrepolvo, separador de tela y hojas delgadas pero resistentes. Tiene un aire a libro ""oldie"" pero bien cuidado. La letra es bastante pequeña pero no tuve problema con eso. El inglés es un nivel intermedio por las diversas descripciones de los paisajes.

Respecto al la historia:
Directo a favoritos. Me hizo reír, llorar y añorar Tejas Verdes. La autora crea un personaje tan sincero, original y risueño que es muy difícil que no te agrade; Ana tiene un pasado bastante triste y a pesar de ello siempre trata de ver el lado bueno de las cosas, sin negar que hay tiempo para estar feliz o para estar triste. Al llegar con los hermanos Cuthbert su vida cambia totalmente ya que no es precisamente una ""niña deseada"", pero conforme pasa el tiempo se va ganando el corazón de estos hermanos y de todos nosotros.El final fue la cereza del pastel, hermoso, desgarrador, en donde se establece una conexión especial entre la historia de Ana y el lector. Me dejó encantada. 英語の大きさが程よく、読みやすかったです。紙のクォリティーも高く満足してます。
欠点は、重いくて持ち運びが大変です。 En un principio compré esta edición por su portada, es una edición sencilla, de bolsillo, bastante normalita. También habría que tener en cuenta que en esta edición tan sólo existen los dos primeros libros, es decir Anne of Green Gables y Anne of Avonlea.
Lo que realmente importa es la historia que cuenta, es un libro entrañable que nos cuenta la historia de Anne Shirley, una huérfana que es adoptada por Mathew y Marilla Cuthbert. Anne tiene una imaginación desbordante que hará disfrutar al lector con sus locuras. Libro divertido, entretenido que sin duda recomiendo a niños y a mayores que quieran pasar un buen rato. I purchased this book as a potential tool for ESL classes, to introduce a bit of Canadian culture. I re-read it for the first time in many years, finished it in a couple days at most and fell in love with the world of Green Gables all over again."
Twelve Years a Slave (AmazonClassics Edition),"Born into “the blessings of liberty in a free State,” Solomon Northup was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Bayou Boeuf region of Louisiana’s Red River Valley. Twelve Years a Slave is the chronicle of his captivity at the mercy of sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps, who tested Northup’s tenacity and self-control under the most brutal conditions. Until fate brought a Canadian abolitionist to Epps’s farm, Northup thought he would never draw another free breath.
To this day Northup’s harrowing memoir is recognized as the most reliable, accurate eyewitness account of the daily lives of slaves. As a significant historical reference, it is unsurpassed. As an authentic narrative of a man starved of his freedom, it is unforgettable.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from iconic authors. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or revisit an old favorite, these new editions open the door to the stories and ideas that have shaped our world.
Revised edition: Previously published as Twelve Years a Slave, this edition of Twelve Years a Slave (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Edit—this is the link Amazon gave me so this is the edition I read. I read a 99¢ Kindle edition. There were some obvious typos and wrong words. It looks like it might have been done with optical character recognition. I only recall one or two sentences in the book whose real wording could not be divined. It was not so big a problem to interfere with my voracious reading of this outstanding book. I enjoyed the convenience of an cheap Kindle version, but I will likely purchase a critical edition in the future.

This is not just an important historical document, it is a gripping story. Witten in eloquent English prose (with occasional Victorian flourishes in language as well as deference to public modesty), it offers a compelling tale rich with vivid and detailed descriptions of slave life on the lower Mississippi circa 1841–1853. Personally for me, as a white Southerner who grew up with the spectre of slavery in the United States heavy on my shoulders, I have not sought out much of this kind of material. Reading it turned out to be a revelation, bringing details into sharp focus—the specifics of the privation, the discomforts, and the wanton cruelty of that society. Just the fact that Northup initially finds himself with several other free persons who were abducted into slavery is chilling. It must have happened a lot, and in an era when by law no slaves could be imported into the U.S.—they had to come from existing ""stock"". So this business of abducting free men and women must have been a brisk trade in those days.

Nor is this book a nonstop grind of horror. It is certainly harrowing, but there are moments of joy and humor (intended and unintended—there is a hilarious passage where he describes in his oblique Victorian way that he subdued a white man who tried to kill him by kicking him in the testicles). The description of slave Christmas is memorable and deeply melancholy. There is a very funny description of several slaves at a Christmas dance competing for the affections of a girl named Lively. There are also thought provoking observations about human nature and the times Northup lived in, as well as fascinating details about agricultural practices.

I feel this book has deepened my compassion for my African-American contemporaries and the size of the problems they face. I look forward to reading more slave narratives. I remember being impressed by Frederick Douglass and his powerful, lyrical prose, but all I read has been things he wrote in the cause of Abolition. I am looking forward to reading his account of being born a slave and becoming literate under that condition, and gaining his freedom. It will present an interesting contrast with Northup's tale, since he was born a free man in the North, and was kidnapped and forced into bondage.

Every American should read this book. I wish it was assigned in every public school in maybe seventh or eighth grade. This detailed look at the experience of slavery from the point of view of someone who was very intelligent with a great memory, a great stylist of English, and having the perspective of growing up a free man gives the reader a rare front seat to history in a gripping and satisfying story. As slave stories go, this one is, in my view, without peer. Northup's s captivating tale -- which has gained attention because of the movie that shares the book's title -- is told in exacting detail with an easy prose. He sets the stage masterfully, describing people and places before proceeding into the narrative. Unlike works of fiction, this book is so compelling because, by all accounts, it is true. There is no polemical axe to grind, as with Uncle Tom (a novel at one point wryly referenced by Northup). Here you see both the brutality of slavery and the moments of kindness by slaves and even some slave owners. Solomon tells the story with clarity and intelligence.

The free versions on other sites I found were pretty poorly formatted, so spending a dollar for a polished version on Amazon is worthwhile, but this one is not the best of them. Granted, the book is formatted adequately, and any typographical errors in this version seem to be simple reproductions of the original.

However, the supporting material is a letdown. I read the version that includes the introduction by novelist Dolen Perkins-Valdez. That introduction is borderline insulting, as it makes only a weak attempt to separate accounts with fictional elements like Roots from an authentic account like this one. Worse still, Perkins-Valdez can't resist indulging in repeatedly referencing her own recently released slave novel, even going so far as to quote herself. There are almost no historical elements to this version beyond the main book -- no mention of Northup after the book, no mention of he writer who helped him pen the book, nothing. There is more information on the writer of the introduction than there is the author. One other oddity worth mentioning: the original book's preface -- the one done by the man who helped Northup write the book -- has been curiously excised from this version too. That makes this version something less than complete.

For those looking for a better version, you might consider , which contains a robust amount of supporting material and, better still, is right now the same cost as this version. Il libro e' la storia avvincente di un uomo libero che viene attirato in una trappola e venduto come schiavo al Sud degli USA. Fino a quando un uomo di buon cuore segnala la sua situzione ai famigliari che riescono a liberalo. dopo 12 anni di schiavitu ""Twelve Years A Slave"" is a roughlly 300 page book that once you pickup you just can't put it down. It tells the story of Soloman Northrup, who actually is the writer, who was a second gen free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South. For his kidnappers it was strictly for monetary gain. The sad thing is...how many others did this happen to who weren't able to regain their freedom!
I read this book in one 24 hour period ( a working day, none the less ) and was totally engrossed in this riveting story. It is well told and is a bold, truthful statement on the evils of slavery, and how engrained it was into the life and culture of the south. The most salient point is that it was written by some one who was actually there. Not a narrative of some resercher 100 years after the fact. Amazing....It really was not that long ago that all this happened.
Buy it.......1.99 is more than worth it. Its a great educational and eye opening read. I found the book interesting and loved the fact that it was the original story, written using the terms and language of the day. It really highlighted the horrors of slavery and the bigotry of the times. Dieses Buch gehört - genau wie ""Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl"" (Harriet Ann Jacobs) - in jeden Geschichts- und Ethikunterricht.

Solomon Northrup erzählt seine Geschichte, sein Leid, die Ungerechtigkeiten und Unmenschlichkeit seiner Zeit auf unglaublich eindringliche und trotzdem irgendwie distanzierte Art und Weise. Oft hatte ich den Eindruck, er minimiert sein persönliches Leid zugunsten der Beschreibung der Schicksale einiger seiner Leidensgenossen. Zudem schildert er sehr plastisch die geographischen, politischen und allgemein sozialen Gegebenheiten seiner Zeit. Man hat davon schon oft gehört und /oder gelesen - man hat darüber gesprochen (und hoffentlich auch nachgedacht) . . . aber das Lesen und somit ""Miterleben"" aus der ureigensten Sicht und Erlebniswelt eines Betroffenen, hinterläßt doch ganz andere, viel eindringlichere Spuren als bloßer Geschichtsunterricht.

Das Solomon Nothrup's Leidensweg sich in der Mitter des 19. Jhd. abspielt, ist die Sprache und Erzählweise dementsprechend etwas antiquiert - somit allerdings auch enorm authentisch. Mit nur grundsätzlichen Englischkenntnissen wird sich sicherlich mancher schwer tun, die Gesamtheit der sprachlichen Beschreibungen zu verstehen.

Nun möchte man sagen, dass dies alles Leid, Ungerechtigkeit, Unmenschlichkeit einer vergangenen Epoche ist - tragisch aber lange vorbei. Ist das wirklich so ? Wenn ich überdenke, was in unserem heutigen, aufgeklärten, vernetzten Informationszeitalter alles an Menschenhandel abläuft, noch weitverbreitet Sklavenhandel und Sklaverei zum akzeptierten Alltag gehört, komme ich zu dem Schluß, dass dieses Buch leider kein Geschichtsbuch, bzw. die Teilautographie eines lang vergangenen Jahrhunderts ist, sondern eine Beschreibung der Demütigungen, Schmerzen, Erniedrigungen und Ausbeutung, die auch heute noch recht global verbreitet ist.

Schon deshalb ist dieses Buch ein absolutes Lese-MUSS - nicht nur für den Geschichtsinteressierten, sondern für jeden, der seine Augen nicht verschlossen halten möchte und jeden, den mehr intereissert als die allgemeinen Alltagsfreuden unserer westlichen Welt.

Das Leiden des Sklaven ""Platt"" ist vorbei - das Leiden der Zwangsprostituierten, Billigst-Sklavenarbeiter, Kindersklaven der heutigen Welt noch lange nicht ! A poignant memoir and a remarkable story set in one of the dark chapters of American history. This book must be read as a reminder of the unimaginable depths that human behavior can plummet. Scarcely could we imagine what great suffering can be inflicted upon fellow human beings. Written with great simplicity and honesty, a narration of slavery and freedom that is so moving at all times. Must read book."

AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as A Little Princess, this edition of A Little Princess (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. An excellent edition of A Little Princess by SeaWolf Press, which I recommend highly. The paperback is very well printed on good cream-colored paper, and durably bound – easy to hold and read. I have ordered several of their books now as gifts for the step-grandchildren, ages 3 to 10, and I love that SeaWolf reprints the original text just as it was, along with original illustrations.

All very old fashioned, of course – but I strongly believe that children ought to understand that the world did not spring into being on the day they were born! As and when they are able to read the text, they will get a good mental workout – the brain, like the body, improves with exercise. And these old books are free of the vulgarity and propaganda – of the right AND the left – that pass for “literature” today.

I never see the families except for a few hours once a year when everybody travels to our house for Christmas dinner and gift-giving. There is no chance of having a chat with the excited kids, and they of course never think to give me any feedback on the previous books I’ve given – nor do their parents.

But I keep sending these books and more modern ones, good stories that inform and delight – trusting that if and when the kids read them, they will get a benefit, though it may be just a little thought in the back of the mind, a lamplight on the road of life that will be helpful sometime or other. Who knows – but it’s the best this retired teacher can do for them. Wow! I loved this so much! I’m really loving children’s classics so far! This was such a heartwarming story! Full of “magic”, imagination, & hope! Sara is just the most amazing little girl ever. She is so unlike other little girls, & I loved every unique thing about her. Her “pretending” really helped her for when things got too hard to bear. It helped her endure all the hardships she had to face. She was good down to the core. Such a fine “little missus”. So many amazing characters! Like Sara & Becky. And some horrible characters like Miss Minchin & Lavinia-ohhh I couldn’t stand them! So awful! Miss Minchin is the worst. The absolute child abuse she does to Sara is horrific. The kindness Sara shows to Becky, & to EVERYONE-even the ones who are horrid to her, is truly remarkable. So many scenes had me emotional, like with the starving girl on the street towards the end, & then everything that happens at the end in general. How you treat people says a lot about you, and everything comes back around to you in time as well. Such an amazing, book hug-able story. So happy I finally read this. Highly recommend. I have a few editions, but I read this beautiful copy I have w/the stunning cover & illustrations by Anna Bond. Beautiful!💜 Beautiful hardcover book, the color illustrations inside are exactly as i remembered them!! This is a wonderful timeless tale!! Really lovely!! Fast shipping too!! Definitely recommend!! Great addition to finish off the collection of classic books with pretty covers. Easy to read and looks pretty on the shelf. When I was younger, I started reading this book, and then I lost it. I couldn't remember its name or author, and now I have completed the story. I am a grown man well into my years, and I am not afraid to admit that I just read this book for the first time ever, and I simply loved it. When I first heard about this book, the description of it sounded like something I would really enjoy reading, but because of the title, I was a little hesitant due to my masculine ego...hehe. But when I found out one of my co-workers, another grown man - lol, that this was one of his favorite books ever, and he also owned the DVD too, I had to give it a read. And I simply could not put it down.

Let me tell you this: Drop Rambo and the Little Princess Sara Crewe down the deepest darkest abyss that you can find, and my money is on Sara Crewe climbing back out alive, and probably carrying Rambo on her little shoulders.

Sara Crewe vs. Freddy Krueger? Ha! Freddy doesn't have a chance!

Seriously, Sara Crewe has to be one of the top best fictional characters of all time. Sara Crewe is like a super hero trapped in a little girl's body. And while she doesn't have any super-powers; she can't climb walls or leap tall buildings, yet, her selfless acts of compassion and kindness, and her courage and determination in the face of adversity are truly heroic and inspirational. And her wonderous imagination, witty mind and dialogue are pure joy to read and will keep you turning the page until you sadly realize the story is already over.

Everyone should read this book, no matter what age.

I bought this little version of the book for my niece as gift because of its little size and cute appearance.

Francess Hodgson Burnett has created a wonder, and this story will forever be a classic and a must read. As it's possible to read A Little Princess via many media, I focus my review on the specifics of this publication as a Penguin Classic. Ulrich C. Knoepflmacher's introduction to the novel will interest academics but is legible to lay readers as well; I have almost no experience with Victorian literary criticism or with Frances Hodgson Burnett studies but still found Knoepflmacher's insights illuminating, and I appreciated the elaborations found in his endnotes. The inclusion of excerpts from other versions of the story was also interesting, though I wondered at the decision to keep the excerpts so brief. But perhaps wanting an omnibus edition of all Burnett's versions of the Sara Crewe story is asking for this to be something it isn't.

The biggest drawback of this edition is that it doesn't include any of the classic illustrations, not the most known ones by Ethel Franklin Betts or Harold Piffard's for the Frederick Warne & Co. edition. I put this edition down realizing how much I missed the illustrations and how much they add to the reading experience. This book continues to enthrall and humble those fortunate to come alive those it depicts. Like Sara, the audience is put in a pretense of a better world where the likes of the protagonist do exist. Burnett's lighthearted writing creates the heaviest emotional impacts and the will to change outlooks. Nothing less as expected from the author who wrote 'The Secret Garden'. This book is such a cozy read with some important lessons on life. Perfect for children (and adults too). Libro consigliato dalla professoressa di inglese di mio figlio da leggersi durante le vacanze: e' piaciuto. 美しく行間がたっぷりとってあり読みやすいです。イラストも素敵です。 Considerado literatura infantil, leí este libro traducido al español cuando aún no era adolescente. A lo largo de la historia descubrimos como alguien acostumbrado a todo tipo de lujos pero privado del afecto más preciado puede verse de la noche a la mañana en la situación más apurada, sin dinero ni familiares a quienes acogerse. Cómo podemos superar las situaciones más desdichadas desde el convencimiento de nuestra propia valía y sin dejar de observar que siempre hay alguien en peor situación que nosotros mismos. En otras palabras, no desde el victimismo sino desde el valor, la lealtad y la generosidad. Hoy en día todos estos elementos están incluidos en cualquier publicación de ""autoayuda"" pero en este cuento son muy sutiles - no olvidemos que se publicó por primera vez como novela en 1905 -.
Una curiosidad: en la versión española, editada en 1961 por Molino y traducida por Mary Duaygües, se omite enteramente el último capítulo del original. Supongo que se debía considerar poco apropiado que la protagonista acudiera en ayuda de los menos favorecidos no desde la caridad (como era de esperar de las señoritas bien, en aquella época, por nuestros pagos) sino desde la legítima defensa de la justicia más elemental."
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (AmazonClassics Edition),"What made Sherlock Holmes a household name and cultural icon? This very first collection of stories featuring the astute sleuth and his loyal assistant, Dr. Watson. In these twelve ingenious mysteries, Holmes is embroiled in betrayal, abduction, thievery, deception, and murder. Relying on logic, driven by instinct, and employing his uncanny powers of observation, Holmes cracks the cases that elude Scotland Yard. For him, it’s rather elementary.
This Baker Street dozen by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is all the evidence readers will need to understand why Sherlock Holmes is an enduring legend in detective fiction.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, this edition of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I admit to being a fan of the great detective Sherlock Holmes. I had read several of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books on Sherlock Holmes and this one (The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes)is one of the very best. What makes this volume so appealing is that it has twelve wonderful short stories. Several of these stories are the best-known cases Sherlock Holmes and his loyal friend Dr. Watson has investigated. I just love the way Holmes always seems to amaze Dr. Watson with his excellent attention to detail, which is a skill all good detectives must develop if they are to succeed in being a good investigator.

This book is organized into twelve tales which include the following: A scandal in Bohemia, The Red-headed League, A case of Identity, The Boscombe Valley mystery, The five orange pips, The man with the twisted lip, The blue carbuncle, The speckled band, The engineer's thumb, The noble bachelor, The beryl coronet and The copper beeches.

In conclusion, if you are a Sherlock Holmes reader you will want to have your own copy of this book for your personal library. On the other hand, if you are a true fan you probably have already read this book. However, if you are not familiar with the great Sherlock Holmes and desire to learn why he is one of the most popular and well-known detectives in the world, pick up a copy of this wonderful text. The twelve short stories will give you a sample of the legendary Sherlock Holmes method of solving mysteries. A great read.

Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Predator Hunter: A warrior's memoir) Sherlock Holmes stories are always worth reading. One aspect that has struck me whenever I have read any of the Sherlock Holmes stories is the lack of action in the sense of gunfire, chases, fights--the usual elements of action thrillers. Most of the overt physical action in the stories occurs off stage. Most of the action is mental and is a journey through the reasoning process of Holmes' brilliant mind as he explains the steps he followed to reach conclusions that only seem obvious when Holmes explains that all the clues were hiding in plain sight.

Many of the stories involve lessons from Holmes to his friend, colleague and chronicler Dr. John Watson. He will explain, for example, how he can determine a man's fall in fortune by the worn condition of his old business suit, the chaffing on his hatband or the depth his razor shaved his cheek as he looked at one side of his face in a mirror. These lessons in deduction have been parodied many times on film; indeed, the originals often seem to be consciously aware of their own absurdity.

One of the most celebrated Holmes stories is the first in the collection: ""A Scandal in Bohemia."" This is one of the few examples where Holmes is unable to triumph as he is outmaneuvered by, of all people, a woman. On more than one occasion Holmes will refer to one case where he did not solve and wrap up all the loose ends of a mystery in his usual manner although he does not always specify that the person that outsmarted him was a woman. Holmes takes understandable pride in his mental prowess and this story, strategically placed as the first in the first collection of stories about him, reveals that this pride can be wounded. His repeated reference to it is proof that he has never forgotten this failure.

Often the stories include standard melodramatic elements--the unsuspecting governess in a vast household in which one forbidden wing of the estate contains scandalous secrets, obsessively jealous or possessive fathers exerting ironclad control over submissive daughters, The stories often pose Holmes' outsider status against an inept police officer, usually the dense Scotland Yard detective Lestrade. This is a familiar pattern in detective fiction following down through non-comformist private detectives such as Philip Marlowe.

The stories are often self-referential as Holmes more than once refers to Watson's distortion of the `facts' of a case or observes that Watson has embellished some details to make the tales more readable rather than presenting Holmes' deductive lectures in their pure or unvarnished state. Holmes is often the professor explaining his methods to his very astute student Watson, who inevitably always comes up short by missing sometimes just one trifling detail that makes all the difference in leading to the truth of the matter.

Often if one takes the mystery setup of the stories at face value they are fairly standard mystery fare. There are other more intricate, more masterfully constructed mysteries. The element that transcends the genre is Holmes himself. Doyle modeled Holmes on his medical doctor guru Joseph Bell and incorporated the teacher/pupil relationship of himself and Bell into the Holmes/Watson relationship. He even modeled Holmes' physical appearance on the much less physically appealing Bell, despite the image that was projected by the original illustrator which formed the template for all future film and stage portrayals of Holmes.

Many heroes need a sidekick or witness and Watson fulfills both roles for Holmes. He is the Boswell to Holmes' Johnson. He is also the surrogate ordinary man observing the observer, presenting his superior master in a way that renders him more understandable and relatable to mere mortals. The tales belong even more to him that they do to Holmes. We never get Holmes' own account of any of these incidents; we only see him as Watson sees him. This dynamic between the genius and his witness is what has ensured that the Holmes stories are still being read over a century after they were written. A thorough joy to listen to the Prime reading free audio edition. The reader does a great job and the stories are, of course, as captivating as previous generations have found them. Frankly, classic novels terrify me a little bit. And it's been a looooong time since I voluntarily picked one up to read (and as we're all good friends here and in a safe circle, I must admit that I made it through about 5 pages of the last one...Wuthering Heights...before placing back on my bookshelf and walking away slowwwly so as not to anger it). So, I decided to read Sherlock with hesitant excitement - you see, I'm a sucker for British crime drama, which is furthered drastically when Robert Downey Jr. is involved in my mental picture of the main character.

But I digress...

Sherlock started out a bit slowly for me (as classics tend to do). It took me about an adventure and a half to get used to Doyle's formal writing style. But once I got the hang of the lingo, it was smooth sailing from there. True, many of the 12 adventures were very similar to each other - almost a same story, different time sort of thing - but I still loved it. Sherlock is a charming nutcase, and I loved seeing Watson go along with all of his best buddy's strangely genius ideas. It's a classic, I enjoyed this original collection of stories with suspense, action, logic , lessons, that create a whole mindset to view and observe the details in life I was buying this edition for my 9-year-old, who needs help from Word Wise. Although it is listed, it barely has any explanations. the stories are timeless... you can read them over and over, and they are still entertaining... if you study history, you will find that even his creator could not kill the great detective... Gostei muito das historias, mas algumas pessoas podem sentir dificuldades, pois o inglês é britanico e algumas palavras estão em desuso a mto tempo, mas é so procurar o significado ou entender o contexto e fica de boa. top. Conosco a memoria ogni singolo film di Sherlock Holmes ma percepire leggendo ogni singolo istante....è davvero...da provare!
Consiglio! These wonderful stories are so easy to read but not without thrills and anticipation. The full length novels are excellent but the short stories seem to show Holmes’s amazing abilities through Conon-Doyle’s wonderful storytelling much better. I particularly like the length of each story. It is enough to substitute watch a show on television. I intend on reading the rest once I find them. A great amount of the famous short stories of Sherlock Holmes.
Very pleasing to read, especially for foreign students who seek to improve their british english."
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (AmazonClassics Edition),"After Hank Morgan of Hartford, Connecticut, takes a blow to the head, he inexplicably awakens in sixth-century Camelot. At first lost and confused, the time traveler soon realizes that he can use modern knowledge and his ability to foretell the future to his advantage. Consequently, he is granted a place in the king’s court as Arthur’s right-hand man. When the Catholic Church grows fearful of his power, the Connecticut Yankee aims higher and concocts a grandiose plan to bring American ideals to sixth-century England to change the future.
In his imaginative comedy, Mark Twain infuses the eternal story of King Arthur with wit and satirizes past social hierarchies as well as nineteenth-century meritocracy.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, this edition of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" is one of those rarest literary treasures: a comedy that, for all it's hilarity, actually has both a heart and a brain. Not just a set of cheap laughs, as most comedy of any sort is, Mark Twain's classic novel enlightens as it entertains, throwing an unflinching spotlight on the darker elements of human nature both in the Utopian (to our eyes) Camelot and of modern capitalism and the American Dream.
The plot is a familiar one in our age of sci-fi and fantasy, though it was innovative when Twain conceived it: Hank Morgan, an enterprising 19th-century engineer, is knocked unconscious and comes to in King Arthur's fabled Camelot. Bewildered but determined to make the best of the situation, Morgan uses his knowledge of history and mechanical skills to convince everyone he is a super-magician greater than even Merlin. Once ensconced as the King's right-hand man, Morgan sets about reforming the country into a republic, a sort of prototype America. Most of the book follows Morgan through a series of haphazard adventures which Twain uses to illuminate the great but often forgotten evils of the Dark Ages, including the abuses of the Catholic Church, the ignorant and useless ruling body that inevitably arises from a monarchy, and the pitiful working conditions of the medieval peasant or slave.
Nor is Twain's critical eye trained only on the far-flung past. Though Morgan is essentially a sympathetic figure, he struggles to find anything the least bit admirable about the knights and nobles he must live with, and considers the chivalric code merely fit for derision. Meanwhile, Morgan's own capitalist code is in full effect, and he takes advantage of every opportunity to cash in his advanced education for the big bucks.
Colorful and sublimely written, Twain's time-travel masterpiece is both a magical fantasy and a stinging dystopian satire. Don't be fooled by the several movie versions of this story, some of which are great fun in their own right. Yes, the novel is funny, often riotously so, but the humorous skin hides a deadly earnestness beneath, and the finale is far less optimistic than one who has first seen the film versions will doubtless expect. A deservedly immortal literary gem. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court (a book by Mark Twain himself) is the tale of a soul from the late 19th century by the name of Hank Morgan, who one day after a blow to the head, somehow travels back in time and finds himself in 6th century Arthurian England. With his modern knowledge of technology, Hank is able to convince the people he is a very skilled magician even outclassing the likes of Merlin and earns himself a very important seat in King Arthur’s court and becomes known far and wide by the nickname, “The Boss”. With his high ranking position and knowledge from thirteen centuries in the future, this Yankee tries to reform England from the inside.

This book was strangely interesting to me, and for many good reasons. I read this book for a school assignment and finished it way before my project deadline (very rarely do I finish a book for school so quickly). I enjoyed how Mark Twain developed the main character’s conflicting attitudes throughout the story. For every moment he seemed very unsympathetic and mean there was an equal moment where he was the most fragile and empathetic being in the entire story. To me, Hank’s character represented the duality of human nature as well as its ability to adapt to a variety of different situations. Although Hank stated to originally hate and despise the culture and society of the time he was transported to, across the book you see him become accustomed to it as he adapts, builds relationships, and even, later on, builds a family for himself in this accursed time. But even so, he still holds the idea that his time is superior. It isn’t until toward the end of the book, but eventually, Hank is able to advance England with the introduction of the telephone and even names the child he has “Hello Central”, which is what telephone operators would say when you called the telephone office in his time. In the midst of all the comedy and satire throughout the book, that plot point was the big dash of irony that I feel defines Hank’s character and made him human and relatable.

What I didn’t like about the book was the childish criticism about the Catholic Church, which wasn’t exactly wrong but was expressed in a way that got boring over time. The Church was a big part of the governmental system in the 6th century, and so as such, it has a large impact on the course of the book. The Yankee, coming from America where the separation of church and state exists as well as most likely living amongst more Protestants, outwardly hates on the Catholic Church and their toxic influence over the peasants of England as well as the nobility in his commentary. His opinions about The Church are well supported and reasonable, but over time it gets boring as he always seems to blame everything on them. It seemed like a very childish way of expressing his genuine distaste, and it got old when The Church didn’t seem to have a very direct role in the story for most of the book (though they do later on). It made me think of when in Scooby-doo they always say “And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids,” except in Hank’s case it is more annoying and would say “And I would be able to revolutionize England if it wasn’t for that meddling Church!” Hank would also say it at least once every chapter. I mainly got irritated because it was the SAME thing EVERY time he mentioned them. But luckily, that was one of the only things I had a problem with in the book, and I have more things that I liked about it than not.

My favorite part of reading this book was getting to experience the peculiar sense of humor that Twain littered throughout the entire book. The time the book was written in was full of nothing but tragedy, and we are constantly hit with the realities of slavery, disease, and great poverty that plague the land. Naturally, you’d think that a time with such suffering would be hard to make very comedic (especially to the point of making a reader laugh aloud), but there’s something about how Mark Twain utilizes ‘dark humor’ that makes parts of the book hilarious. There are two parts in particular in which I think this ‘dark humor’ made me laugh the most. The first was rather early on and broke me with a single sentence, “For some reason or other the queen had the composer hanged after dinner.” The queen in question was King Arthur’s half-sister, Morgan Le Fay, who is presented to be one of the most heartless characters in the book. What had me on my knees in laugher was how casually her cruelty was expressed. There wasn’t a reason specified for the hanging, she didn’t do it because he had angered her or because he had said something outwardly mocking her, she just did it “[f]or some reason or other”. The second instance was simply the title of one of the later chapters, “The Yankee and the King Sold as Slaves.” The King and Hank end up going undercover with the common folk, but in the process get captured and sold as slaves, not even selling for more than the average slave. While it is commenting on a very serious subject, imagining such a high and mighty figure such as the legendary King Arthur getting sold as a slave, being worth no more than about average, is priceless to me. While reading it I thought “where’s your divine right now?” Both instances are probably moments that in another book, could be the most devastating and intense scenes in the entire story. But with Mark Twain’s way of twisting the situation, sometimes you can’t help but laugh.

Overall, this book has become one of my favorites out of all the stories I’ve read for school. If you are someone who takes books very seriously, I would definitely stay away from this book. But if you’re someone who is okay with a little bit of questionable humor that is in no way meant to be taken seriously, then I would definitely recommend reading this book. Besides the satire and comedy, this book also has a lot to offer in terms of intricate themes and complex messages that I feel can only be truly understood if you read the book itself. As the author of this book, Mark Twain never ceased to amaze me. I feel that through his writing, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court could potentially offer something to anyone who reads it and is definitely worth the time to finish. What a great novel! Twain is wonderfully funny, yet his scathing social commentary concerning his own times are as serious as a heart attack.

When a Connecticut Yankee gets sent back in time to King Arthur's Court, he decides his superior knowledge should be used to educate such an ""ignorant race."" Of course, we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if I didn't know better, I would say that the person who coined the phrase did so after finishing this novel. The story's main character, Hank Morgan, is a likeable, if not laughable character, yet as most of us already know: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once technology gets on a roll, the beast of civilization takes off running and Morgan cannot pull in the reigns. Total disaster ensues (incase you had not already guessed).

This was a fun read and a look at a problem that is still very much alive today. Too much civilization can be like a disease, especially when those who are working to spread it find that they are doing it for reasons other than altruism.

Also, do you remember the scene in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" when Indiana Jones whips out his gun to shoot the sword-wielding Sultan? That scene was surely lifted from this very book!

Trust me, this is a novel for thought, but one that will not bore you. Twain was a master and this is perhaps my favorite of his novels. Very highly recommended. Great story, but the PAPERBACK version of this book has incredibly small type face. I mean it is really TINY. You can hardly see it. If you want a paperback version, find another one. Not sure what the publisher was thinking when they made this. One of the best books I've ever read. I went into it expecting a gently comedic adventure with fish-out-of-water humour. What I got was an incisive, satirical, hugely intelligent book that lambasts and lampoons social ills that are just as relevant today as they were in Twain's time, or Arthur's. If you ever wanted to turn someone atheist, liberal, or just that little more open-minded, this would be one of the best ways to do it, as Twain covers the subjects of human rights, religion, political power, sensible economics and human endeavour with admirable clarity and excellent vignettes that effectively act as fables. I am interested in books illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman. Buen libro para empezar a leer inglés en un nivel medio, para empezar a coger vocabulario y ver la gramática Mark Twain's classic comic novel in a wonderfully packaged volume, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is essentially one of those books that will crack you up everytime you read it. And I mean, it WILL crack you up for sure. I had read the book in its abridged format as a child and was thoroughly amused, and I picked this up in its complete format because much like the phenomenally funny works by Jerome K Jerome, I cannot resist Twain's works either. If you are in the search for some classic witticisms, look no further. You have arrived at the right place.

Ich habe Buch und Inhalt genossen. Wer hätte es gedacht: oft weit moderner, als man denken möchte. Und das trotz des Alters (immerhin von 1889)! Im Umkehrschluss bedeutete das aber auch, dass einiges sich seitdem weiterhin noch nicht genug zum Besseren gewandelt hat, und manches leider auch schon den Zenith hinter sich zu haben scheint (vielleicht ist es ja auch nur ein Sattelpunkt :))

Immer wieder erfrischend auch die Seitenhiebe gegen die deutsche Sprache. Ich bewundere die Leute, die Deutsch als Fremdsprache gelernt haben und sprechen, Hut ab! Englisch ist aber auch fein ;)"
Anna Karenina (AmazonClassics Edition),"Beautiful, popular, and fortunate, Anna Karenina is an upright wife and mother. But her passionless marriage to a senior statesman leads her into the arms of Count Alexey Vronsky. The dashing cavalry officer stokes in her something exciting and defiant. In abandoning the rules of her noble station, she’s aware of the risks: a degraded reputation and the hostile recriminations of St. Petersburg society. But there are even greater stakes as Anna follows desires both romantic and carnal, emancipating and destructive.
The embodiment of the clash between Russia’s old-world tradition and its liberal reform, Leo Tolstoy’s willful heroine remains one of the most notorious and tragic in all of world literature.
Revised edition: Previously published as Anna Karenina, this edition of Anna Karenina (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. First let me say, and you may have guessed if you read my reviews regularly, I listened to this book on audiotape. A bonus was it was one of my favorite voice actors, Devina Porter, that did the narration. Her skills and talent shone brightly in this book and I was very glad to have her as the narrator. It took me over a month to get through, and I have a long commute. However, I feel that it was well worth my time.

Secondly, I was blown away by this book. I had always heard that Tolstoy was dry, long-winded, and boring, however, I found the book very interesting, detailed, and in the same spirit (not topics or subjects of course) as Jane Austen and the Bronte sisters. I have placed it on my 100 Books to Read Before You Die list with Jane Eyre. I find it somewhat more informative than the writings by the women because it gives a full snapshot of what life was like in turn-of-the-century Russia.

The book essentially follows two couples – Anna and Vronsky, Levin and Kitty. There are numerous other important characters, but mostly it revolves around how everyone interacts with these four people. Anna is married to Alexei Karenin, but falls in love with Vronsky, causing numerous issues with her marriage. Levin is a country gentleman who has loved Kitty for years, but has never been brave enough to offer his hand. When he attempts to Vronsky stands in his way and he feels defeated. Both couples relationships grow and radiate, twist and turn, hum with love, and snag and break in different times, for different reasons, and in different ways. It is quite an emotional book for the period.

What I found extremely fascinating was the descriptions, explanations, and portrayal of turn of the century Russian society a short time after the Revolution. I had known nothing about Russia, its history or its people. I learned a lot just reading the book. Through the characters you learned about how the whole populace functioned, from the princes to the commoners, and their attitudes toward each other. Attitudes and ideas about education, women’s rights, politics, etc. were also discussed, these three topics being the most primary, along with agriculture and labor. The author gave an honest and effective portrayal of how society was both attempting and not attempting to change at the same time.

Furthermore, the book gave an exemplary account on the subtle influences of relationship. It is a great study on how insecurity, depression, stress, and social isolation effects people. Additionally, trust and pride are also shown in the different relationships. The commonplace attitude of mistresses and women’s places help to demonstrate the role of marriages and children. It was interesting to see how society and individuals were so influenced and could influence the happiness of others.

I would recommend this book to any serious reader. It is very long and you have to be determined to finish it, but it is well worth it. I would suggest audiobook as well, as I find it very enjoyable and helps to ease the dryness of some of the passages. All in all, it is a fantastic literary work. In opening, I want to endorse the idea of reading this novel on Kindle. This is a lonnnggg novel, and using Kindle allows one to avoid lugging around a hardcopy the size of a toaster. And . . . Tolstoy's (or the translator's) vocabulary is extensive and includes the obscure and archaic. Kindle allows one to instantly display word definitions without continually reaching for the dictionary (small dictionarys won't have some of these words). I read 74% of the book (another Kindle benefit, tracking your completion percentage) on a two week cruise. The Kindle method was a huge plus.

Now, about Anna Karenina. It's wriiten second person, told from the perspective of the 19th century Russian ruling class. Most of the characters are titled, and/or landowners, and/or published, and so on. Several themes and subplots are at play. In no particular order: Assorted romantic arrangements with broken hearts, broken families, busted finances, shunning, trysts, and a rare exceptional success. The Balken war. The interplay between the ruling class and the peasant class. Religion and the nature of worship and God. Family and chidbirth. Work ethic. Horses and horse racing (in the absence of autos and auto racing). Substance abuse. Suicide. Good and bad advice. Foolish people.

That's all I'll say, avoiding re-explaining the plot. At the risk of incurring my readers' wrath, I will offer a few negative criticisms . . . .

The book could have achieved the same lessons and greatness without having been so darned long. Toward the last fourth or so, I was strongly impressed that the author was just ""running on"" and wasn't sure how, or if ever, he was going to wrap this up.

Secondly, Tolstoy really overdid it on the ""knowing looks"" and ""reading his eyes"" thing. Seemingly the characters could interpret no only truth or fiction, but often whole personalities and situations simply by a quick assessment of the gleam in their subject's eye. This was ubiquitous and became rather ridiculous. Would that I had such talent (really nobody does, at least as portrayed in the novel).

There are a BUNCH of characters, and the unfamiliar sounding Russian names don't help. I would like to say I had them all sorted out - but I don't think so.

And finally, the religion thing. Not a popular topic in book reviews, but it's not only in the novel, it is the culmination of the book. Tolstoy was a great mind, and took on a big responsibility in Anna Karenina to address the issues of religion, worship, and God. As Leon Uris was wont to do in Trinity, or William Golding in The Spire, Tolstoy shows thinly veiled and often witty disdain for organized religion and it's trappings, money, and control culture. I'm with him on this and felt that he came very, very close to defining true religion (in the Judeo-Christian sense). However, I'm a bit of a Bible scholar, and maintain that the great Tolstoy still missed hitting the bullseye. He dealt with ethical living, love for others, the ""silent"" but real presence of God and the quiet mysterious suggestions of what Christians refer to as the ""Holy Spirit"", but he was still inclined to sort out religion through the filter of what he had been raised in. He left a room unexplored - the much debated issue of obedience to God's commandments. Like 'em or hate 'em, they are there. I would like to have seen Tolstoy's thoughts on this . . . dealing for instance with issues sabbath-keeping (or not), or covetousness (present in the book), or with adultery (certainly present in this novel) - all these as weighed through the written requirements of the Judeo-Chritian scriptures. Again, not an easy subject, but Tolstoy was dealing with God and religion in spades as he closed the book. So how did the characters do (by inferrence, how are ""we"" doing?)

Great novel. Maybe a bit too long. Maybe not totally realistic or perfect - but close. Deals deeply and intelligently with a wide, wide, range of human topics. What an amazingly well written book. It is a painting in words. Lots of passages to think about. Everybody should read it. Jeszcze nie czytałam ale przyszła w niektórych miejscach uszkodzona الغلاف الخلفي متضرر من الطرف و صراحه كنت متوقعه هالشيء لأنه اغلفة بينقوين بلاك سباين ضعيفه بشكل عام ، ما عدا كذا الكتاب تمام و بصراحه تفاجأت انه الخط نوعاً ما صغير The internal dialogue portrayed in each of the principle characters, their doubts,assumptions and labouring over gaining understanding and consequent misunderstandings seem to be a big part of the human condition.
I often found it hard to follow with the constant use of different names used for most of the characters. It wasn't what I would call a easy read, long and hard going at times. In the end I found it all worthwhile. the book had lots dents, you could see scratches on the cover under light. the price tag sticker on the back was also torn off so there’s a mark left there. but for the price i paid im not really mad. only get if you are ok with it not being in perfect condition!"
Tarzan of the Apes (AmazonClassics Edition),"John Clayton III, an orphan boy, comes of age in the western coastal jungles of Africa following the tragic deaths of his aristocratic parents.

Revised edition: Previously published as Tarzan of the Apes, this edition of Tarzan of the Apes (AmazonClassics Edition) The work of Edgar Rice Burroughs should interest and inspire author and reader alike. As a pencil salesman, he sold pencil advertisements in the pulp fiction publications of his day. He found the published stories not very good and thought he’d try his hand at writing. After all, if they were publishing such drivel, why not his drivel? Amazingly, he sold his first piece, which began the John Carter of Mars series. Shortly thereafter, he began what made his fortune and allowed him to name his own town Tarzana after Tarzan of the Apes.
The character of an Englishman of noble birth, raised in the wilds of Africa by great apes captured the imagination of many and deservedly so. Tarzan is one of the seminal fictional characters and has never been depicted as well as Burroughs imagined him.
Raised as an ape, he speaks and understands their language, which is also spoken by monkeys and baboons. His sense of smell is highly developed and he is taught to hunt and kill to eat. When a great ape makes a kill, he lets forth with a terrifying howl of victory that lets the rest of the jungle know. It’s a fearsome sound and nothing like Johnny Weissmuller’s glorious yodel. After killing the great ape that was his stepfather, he sets out on his own and discovers the cabin his real father made after being marooned on the African coast.
Inside the cabin, he discovers the skeletons of his parents as well as his father’s knife, which will serve him through the rest of the series. Also inside the cabin are books that were meant for a boy’s instruction. In a fascinating and ingenious sequence, he teaches himself to read and write English without knowing how the language sounds. After rescuing a French soldier from cannibals, he learns French before English.
Among his enemies are Numa, the Lion; Sheeta, the Panther; Hista, the Snake and cannibals. Enemies are what help define protagonists and through the series, there are enemies galore. There are Germans, Swedes, Russians, Communists, Arabs, Shiftas (bandits) and Japanese who find themselves up against the Ape-Man.
Tarzan is fluent in French and English as well as the language of the beasts and the native African tribes who have learned to fear and respect him. He becomes king of the Waziri and them, his loyal subjects and armed force.
The Johnny Weissmuller films are filled with scenes of Tarzan calling for hordes of jungle beasts to charge white hunters and whatever enemy is on the horizon destroying his jungle paradise. Unlike Weissmuller, Tarzan is quite articulate. In the books, the only scene with an animal charge (other than when Tantor is employed) is when Tarzan persuades a baboon king to send his horde of baboons to attack his enemies. Otherwise, his power over animals is limited. Tantor, the Elephant, is Tarzan’s friend and is happy to carry him on his back to wherever he wishes to go.
However, in The Beasts of Tarzan resides an extraordinary sequence, where after becoming the chief of a tribe of great apes and saving a panther from a trap that would otherwise have cost it its life, the beasts join Tarzan in his quest to recapture his bride, Jane. Together with marooned sailors, the apes row a hollowed-out tree to the coast of Africa while Sheeta, the panther drools over the sailors but will not eat them out of loyalty to the Lord of the Jungle. Not so, the fate of Jane’s abductors. Any mention of animal loyalties would be amiss without mentioning the Golden Lion, Jad-bal-ja, whom Tarzan raised from a cub to become his ally and watcher. More than one enemy is vanquished by Tarzan’s loyal avenger, who will not attack any of Tarzan’s friends.
In the first part of Tarzan Returns, he wears clothing, fights off killers in Paris and is hired by the French government to go undercover in North Africa. He’s more like James Bond and quite skilled with a gun in his hand in addition to his superior physical prowess.
One of the major threads that runs through the novels are the lost worlds hidden in the Dark Continent. The first of the worlds is Opar, a city and civilization originally from Atlantis and its queen, La. Opar and La figure in several subsequent novels.
Lost worlds are a throwback to the 19th-century writings of H. Rider Haggard, H.G. Wells, and Jules Verne. Among the lost worlds Burroughs imagined are two warring Roman cities, warring Crusaders who took a wrong turn returning from the Holy Land, warring civilizations of cat people, warring religious fanatics among many others.
The novels are at their best when focusing on Tarzan and his Waziris, his son, and wife, Jane.
The series lost momentum after shifting focus to lost worlds rather than keeping sharp focus on Tarzan. He even cross-fertilized Tarzan with the Pelucidar series sending the Ape-Man to the Earth’s Core. The stories are at their best when focusing on Tarzan himself. Burroughs created one of the great and most enduring characters of fiction. He revolutionized science fiction and fantasy. He predicted many medical advances and probably inspired discoverers and inventors with his audacious fiction.
One barrier for many modern readers is the language used in 1912. There are many archaic terms and descriptors used, but as the series progresses the language evolves and is less off-putting.
One note on the version I read. The later novels were digitized utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software because there are missing periods and abbreviations that don’t make sense otherwise. The letters “Ms” are in place of where it should have read “his” for example among many other artifacts. The edition I read cost 99 cents for 25 complete novels. Figuring out what the word should have been should be easy enough for the reader and well worth the minor extra effort.
Burroughs pulls the series out of the lost world rut in Tarzan and the Lion Man where he infuses the story with science fiction ideas usually found in the Barsoom series. A mad scientist has created a race, crossing gorillas with men. It’s a thrilling entry to the series with brilliant elements of horror in it. That novel was written in 1933-34 with a subplot involving a Hollywood production of a Tarzan-like feature filmed on location in Africa. References to Burroughs’ success in Hollywood continue as characters refer to Lord Greystoke as “a regular Tarzan” not knowing who he really is. Once we reach World War II in Tarzan and the Foreign Legion, Lord Greystoke is a British Army Colonel who reveals his true identity to the band of warriors fighting the Japanese on the island of Sumatra.
No discussion of Burroughs’ Tarzan novels would complete without mentioning the “Tantor” in the room: race. It’s important to keep in mind that Burroughs was a product of his time and his writing reflects what were many prevailing attitudes and ideas of the day. The essential idea of a British nobleman raised by apes only to realize the promise of his superior genes is rightly regarded today as racist. Tarzan hates the black tribes he first meets but one must keep in mind that they were also cannibals. There is liberal use of what is now referred to as the N-Word throughout the books. Tarzan himself doesn’t use the word but many of the white characters do and most of those are Tarzan’s enemies. Throughout the novels, Tarzan is frequently predisposed to help a person because they are white and is callous to the fate of the black tribesmen he encounters.
In Tarzan’s defense, he frequently prefers the law of the jungle to the law of man. He would rather be eaten by a lion or a tiger or gored by a rhinoceros than have the knife of a duplicitous man stab him in the back. The books are replete with wry observations of Tarzan’s preference for the savage natural world over civilization.
Burroughs gradually evolved his regard for the black tribes. By the time the novels mature, Tarzan relies on a tribe of blacks known as his Waziri and its chief, Muviro. They become the source of many a deus ex machina while coming to his rescue. They are noble, beautiful and strong. He infuses them with loyalty, self-sacrifice, intelligence, and great courage. They love Tarzan and Tarzan loves them. We could all use allies such as these.
By the time we reach Tarzan and the Tarzan Twins with Jad-Bal-Ja the Golden Lion, most of Tarzan’s most beloved characters play a part in the resolution of the tale. Tantor is here as well as Nkima, the monkey and his loyal Waziri facing down the half-men of Opar, descended from gorillas.
Edgar Rice Burroughs created one of the most fascinating and enduring characters in literature and was wildly successful in his lifetime. None of the film adaptations captured the essence of the author’s vision but Burroughs was more than happy to laugh all the way to the bank. The novels are high adventure with romance and impossible situations (with sometimes ridiculous storylines) but holding all together is the audacious imagination of Edgar Rice Burroughs, who arguably created modern science fiction and infused many of those fantastic situations from what was one time called The Dark Continent, a place of mystery and limitless possibilities that launched many a fantasy adventure. Most of the writers of more recent science fiction were inspired as boys and girls by the writings of Edgar Rice Burroughs.
The physical courage of Tarzan is something all boys aspire to. Cast off, naked and alone with nothing but our wits and wills to be engines of our survival, there is a part of every person alive who ought to wish to emulate Tarzan. Kipling, in the Jungle Book, maybe the inspiration for Tarzan, wrote a perfect book; his mastery leaves Edgar Rice Burroughs' writing as almost improvised. In Tarzan is not clear at first that different animals don the same name, the coincidences are implausible, and the world population seems to have fifty persons at most. Nevertheless the technically lesser story of Tarzan has a vast bigger impact in our culture than Kipling's lovely narration. The story of a man whose past is lost, raised to be a noble man by adoptive parents, fighting antagonists of superlative strength or superior weapons, gaining peak human strength and stamina, superior intelligence due to his genetic and aristocratic heritage, the intelligent and beautiful lady that he will rescue... all these elements will inspire the story of Superman, so, although imperfect, it goes beyond the Jungle Book to be the foundation of the vast 20th century mythology.

The beginning is a bit exasperating: a couple taking the worst decisions in their way to catastrophe. Circumstances will abandon them in a wild and untouched jungle in the Congo; all continues in tragedy. Each tragedy preparing the path to build the most powerful human being, not only in strength but, different from the classic movies, also in intellect. Without giving spoilers the ending is sad :l and is nothing as I ever saw in other media. The more I read it the more captivating it was. If you have seen movies or read comics, about Tarzan, I can assure you that they are not like this original book. Is an amazing reading, not only despite its defects but even thanks to them.

As a miscellaneous note is the theme about race. I don't think there is a mistreatment. All the races in this book make interesting things, the ape tribe of Mangani is cruel but also adopts Tarzan; the cannibals are inhuman toward prisoners but they also build and respect their divinities; the colonialists abuse the natives but also they investigate to end that abuse, some kill without remorse while others help the most possible. So in the end there is not a prejudice except in modern readers that read what their limited vision allows them to see. In the treatment of gender Jane Porter is in my opinion an echo of one of the greatest heroines of literature as is Shakespeare's Portia; and the inspiration for Louis Lane, a strong and brave woman, not all the men are brave neither, so I don't see a prejudice in it. I don't like mistreatment of animals and Tarzan, what is wonderful, explicitly has learnt to hunt only for food and only if his weapons put him in fair ground, not in superiority.

All in all Tarzan is amazing!!! you can get the AmazonClassics edition. It has X-Ray, there are not mistakes I could notice, modern typography, nice cover, and in general an excellent edition. The only thing I'd like is if I could measure the reading progress by pages and not only by digital positions, other AmazonClassics books have that option. It is not an issue but a choice of subjective comfort. Une lecture très agréable, des ""photos"" qui surgissent de l'imaginaire construit par le cinéma et la bande dessinée et puis même une certaine intuition désormais scientifiquement fondée. Un régal Great story, well written 良き。
意外と読めました。
Chatgpt 使って読みました。 I read this book when I was a child (in an Italian translation) and I enjoyed it very much. Reading it now was interesting and still quite enjoyable. I always love to read books in their original language! Edgar Rice Burroghs in this book writes in a pleasant style, evoking quite successfully the idea of the unexplored African jungle. Also, reading this is 2013, makes it not only a catchy story but an interesting ""historical"" report (about the perception of Africa). This is a book that every child should read, Tarzan has it all, adventure, love, heroism and generosity. Tarzan! Most people will be familiar with the character from the classic Disney film version.

As a fan of the film I wanted to check the source material and I was blown away. Tarzan of the Apes written by Edgar Rice Burroughs is brutal, intense adventure of a young boy, a beast boy who does all he can to survive and become a fighter in the jungle, his education in civilization and his romance with a charming young woman.

The book is over 100 years old so it does have some stereotypes that didn't age well but it a grand adventure novel.

Highly recommended and worth reading the next 2 books in the series, Return of Tarzan and Beasts of Tarzan which completes Tarzan's extended origin story.

The book is free to read in public domain and this Rupa publication edition is cheap but good copy to read in print."
Common Sense (AmazonClassics Edition),"Published anonymously on January 10, 1776, Thomas Paine’s legendary work made the case for American independence.
An immediate sensation across the thirteen colonies, Common Sense extolled Paine’s belief that government should be simple and represent the will of the people, acting not as an oppressor but as a body to protect society. His clear and persuasive argument appealed to the common people, impressing on them the importance of secession from Great Britain. Six months after Common Sense was published, independence was declared, and the American Revolution was born.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Common Sense, this edition of Common Sense (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Excellent book and truly a classic piece of literature.A shame people don't read things like this anymore.Thank you This is the Booklet that started the American revolution, the most proportionally popular book in US history until 2008 when Dan Browns book passed it. But this thrill is more cunning and substantial. It implores Americans, the most literate colony and more literate than the British homeland, to push for independence. The inalienable rights, the imploring the nation not to live under tyranny, the setting up of a navy, the taking on national debt in order to bind the country together into a common cause and union.
These and many other arguments persuaded the colonists, covering every facet and counter argument to break away, not to reconcile. About 75% of the colonists were said to have read it, and most likely passed around to the rest in taverns, through trade. The inalienable rights of each person is argued at the foundation for government, for democracy, rather then the rule of king or tyrant. The language a bit different, old fashioned, but it is the foundational booklet of essential ideas on which the new world is born. This book should be read by all Americans because is makes SENSE !!!!! This little book is an easy way to get a brief glimpse of the time of the American Revolution, the way it sounded and felt to people then.

PROS: It's a primary source, more direct than a history book, yet it's short and easy to read. Of course it's an emotional propaganda piece (for the American side, against the English king) and there are many holes in Paine's arguments, but that's part of the fun of reading a primary source -- you can analyze for yourself. Also, this little edition is nicely printed with a lovely cover.

CONS: A few historical endnotes on some of the contemporary references would have been nice; this edition is purely the original text. Wow! If we ever wonder what our Founding Fathers would think of our country today, all we have to do is read what they intended for our nation to be. This should be a mandatory read for every American on their 18th birthday so they will know exactly what to look for in the politicians who run for office and what we should be able to expect from them. Thomas Paine was such a profoundly important person in the context of the establishment of democracies from the late 18thcentury it is hard to know where to start with a review of this book. His writings supporting the American revolutionary cause are well known and as inspiring as if penned yesterday. We are also treated with his very personal and near fatal experience of the French Revolution and his unwavering support for peaceful change. Paine strove for democracy but not bloody revolution and was horrified when self interested parties abused the power that others had won for a noble end. We read of the very early unravelling of the democratic process in the United States and wonder if the current political environment has its origins in the time when Paine, a Founding Father, was left languishing in imprisonment in Paris by his former Revolutionary comrades in arms. One is constantly marvelling at the clarity and expression of his logic. His writings are brimming with truths which with very little reflection are so obviously self evident. This is a book for not only those interested in the origins of contemporary democracy but for everyone who professes to support the democratic process. It should be required reading for all students. If one wonders what the problems with democracy are today the answers, and way forward, are to be found in this book. It is quite unfortunate that the maladroit public school system has failed to have this as a required reading. Thomas Paine has obtained immortality with these words in the minds of true conservative Constitutionalists-that of which has been obscured by both the Republicrats and Demopulicans. Having not read this in high school, I am glad I did. In a time when America is in an aberration from her fundamental principles I find myself genuflecting to her Constitution for insight-for that I am ridiculed, receive derision, and considered a conspiracy theorist and unpatriotic. Lamentation is among those of us who see the force that is reverting this country to a fusion between Fascism and Communism-a new hybrid of government. Fortunately, this is a REPUBLIC and we can fire back through political intervention and fiscal boycotts. We find it facile to intervene where we must, but that ability is shifting to arduousness with laws such as the Patriot Act-which makes docile dissent an act of terrorism. What Paine wrote in this pamphlet is very well applicable to our relationship to the Federal Government in the present. For me, this book gave me the boon to spread the message of what America was founded upon, the Constitution.

There are those men/women that are born from the process of reproduction that go beyond the mere existence of flesh and truly lubricate their being into the gears of this Machine we call life. From the conception of their ornate thoughts to the inoculation of their fluid into our being, at times we can overlook them in the present, but in the future, we revere them for their message. How many of these individuals have we murdered, assassinated, tortured, ostracized or allowed their message to become senescent in society? The recoil can at times prove that we are indeed merely in duress by the masses, but there are those of us that see the profundity in the present. Thomas Paine was not one who was ostracized or murdered for his ideologies, but it calls forth a siren in the present that is commensurate to Ron Paul's The Revolution: A Manifesto.

If I am not mistaken, I am sure I can be indicted for an act of terrorism, have Storm Troopers breach my home without warrant, be shipped to Guantanamo Bay for torture and denied rights to Due Process, all for exercising my right to free speech by writing this review; and, not to mention, for saying that the Federal Government is subordinate to the Constitution and must yield to the States; States yield to Counties; Counties to Cities; Cities to Communities; and Communities to Families-that is ""the REPUBLIC for which we stand!"" Having not read it fully, i can tell you only about the first few pages and/or the introduction.I came to Thomas Paine via Christopher Hitchens.
Like Paine, Hitchens does not dumb down his words and it's best either to have a good dictionary handy or hop onto http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/
Words like 'usurpation' 'injudicious' and 'extirpating' just in the introduction.Do not let this put you off.Remember it was composed/published in 1775–76 and it is worth the learning curve.
It is a very direct,compassionate questioning of the legitimacy of kings and authority and is worth anyone's time who wants to understand freedom,democracy and american or english history. Todo me gusto Great read サムエル・モリソン『アメリカの歴史』を読んでトマス・ペインの存在を知り、アメリカの独立に大きく貢献したとされるThomas Paine, “Common Sense”を読むことにした。
60ページ程度のごくみじかい英文パンフレットだが、内容は濃い。最初に、あらゆる人民は暴政に対して反乱する権利がある、とおそらくルソーの思想から説く。続いて当時のアメリカの宗主国たるイギリスの王政を、キリスト教の立場からそもそも神の意志に反する不当な制度であって、王位の世襲制がきわめて不合理なことを一般論として指摘したうえで、現実に無能で暴虐であることを指摘する。そして、アメリカがイギリスの支配を受けることの愚かしさと独立の利益を、具体的に指摘する。アメリカ大陸は宗教改革の寸前に発見され、世界の迫害を受ける人民の避難地として神から与えられた地であり、すでにイギリスのみならずヨーロッパ全体から人々が到来している。それなのにイギリスだけに服属し、イギリスから貿易・外交の制限を受け、その意のままに収奪されることの愚かしさをよく考えなければならない。遠く離れてアメリカ大陸の状況をよく把握する術も意欲もないイギリスに、これからもあらゆる重要なことを時間をかけて請願し、遠いところの他人事としか考えない連中のいい加減な判断に従い続けるのか。われわれはアメリカ大陸に居住する人間として、子孫に良い生活環境、国家、政治体制を残さなければならない。われわれは自らの判断で自分たちのための法律を作らなければならないが、それここそが「独立」なのである。さらに単に独立の必要を叫ぶのみでなく、アメリカの現状を詳しく分析して、経済的にも、政治的にも、軍事的にも独立することが可能であることを具体的に説明する。そしてアメリカの新しい政治体制についても提案している。
イギリスの田舎町に職人の子として生まれたトマス・ペインが、仕事にも結婚にも失敗してアメリカにわたった時、すでに37歳になっていた。当時アメリカ大陸内では、独立推進派、イギリスとの和解派、さらに日和見派の3つに分かれて議論があり、当初トマス・ペインは和解派であった。それが、1775年4月のレキシントン・コンコードの戦いでイギリス軍の暴虐とアメリカ民兵の勇気を見て、完全に独立派に変わったという。レキシントン・コンコードの戦いの直後からトマス・ペインは『コモンセンス』の著作に着手したが、流動的な情勢を鑑みて、また引き受けてくれる出版社を探して、出版は1776年1月になった。発売されるとこのパンフレットは空前のベストセラーとなり、50万部をアメリカ大陸で売った。当時アメリカ大陸の人口は250万人ほどというので、文章を読むことができる人々のほぼ全員が読んだことになる。そして半年後のアメリカ独立宣言に、この内容がかなり踏襲されていた。
論述はごく冷静で論理的であり、予想したより扇動的な感じが少ない。内容は新しい理論や思想などのように抽象的ではなく、現状を詳しく観察し分析して、わかりやすく具体的に解説している。これはまさに優れたジャーナリストのものである。さらにありがちな「いわゆるジャーナリスト」や「いわゆる識者」とまったく異なるのが、改革の必要性の指摘だけでなく、改革の方法とその実現可能性の検討、さらに改革後の政治運営のビジョンまで綿密に考察して具体的に提案していることである。本来ジャーナリストというのは、こうあらねばならないのだろう、と改めて思った。わが国の「いわゆる識者」や「いわゆるジャーナリスト」たちには、真摯に反省して少しでもトマス・ペインに近づく努力を求めたいが、おそらく能力不足なのだろう。
また、このパンフレットが対象とする場所も時代も異なるものの、日本の現状にてらして考えると、決してひとごととして放置できない指摘がある。わが国は、憲法で軍事力の保持を否定して、安全保障をアメリカの軍事力に依存しているが、アメリカは当然ながら自国の利益以上に他国たる日本を護る義務などないのである。そのような根本を蔑ろにしたまま現状を継続することの危うさを、われわれ日本国民は真剣に考えなければならない。

Heart of Darkness (AmazonClassics Edition),"River steamboat captain Charles Marlow has set forth on the Congo in Africa to find the enigmatic European trader Mr. Kurtz. Preceded by his reputation as a brilliant emissary of progress, Kurtz has now established himself as a god among the natives in “one of the darkest places on earth.” Marlow suspects something else of Kurtz: he has gone mad.
A reflection on corruptive European colonialism and a journey into the nightmare psyche of one of the corrupted, Heart of Darkness is considered one of the most influential works ever written.
Revised edition: Previously published as Heart of Darkness, this edition of Heart of Darkness (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Heart of Darkness is a definite read for college students studying literature like myself. I also see it capturing the attention of those studying history, but I only see minds matured over the easily-distracted age of fifteen making the most of this experience. Published in 1899 by Joseph Conrad, who was already known for his seafaring career which included travels to Africa, this realistic novel makes for an interesting conversation starter when peeking out of my satchel and therefore well-deserving of 4.9 stars!
Conrad employs imagery and dialogue to convey the harsh reality of the times. He describes the death of a humanity corrupted by a deadly one, resulting in an elegiac reflection of his travels. In this novella, Charles Marlow sets sail on the Congo and finds himself searching for the mysterious Kurtz. During his travels, Marlow sees the brutal treatment of starved natives and encounters obstacles like a ship in need of fixing, an attack, and illness. Once Marlow finds Kurtz, Marlow finds himself holding more power and responsibility than the man he sought, much like the power of knowledge peeking out of my satchel and intimidating many.
I enjoyed reading this book, despite the verbose descriptions interrupting the plot, a challenge I assume may hinder other readers. I also found myself often relating to Conrad’s strong curiosity. Conrad focuses on action as the key tool to develop his characters. Marlow is an authentic character, and the reader experiences all of his conflicting thoughts as he does. We are also given a mental image through Conrad’s characterization of a tired captain giving into his curiosity. Kurtz is also well described by other characters, thus revealing his extensive education and powerful nature, as well as his talents of painting and music. I can also easily relate to his multitalented nature, proven by the vast array of tools in my satchel.
The plot is built on a predictable foundation with the details of mistreated natives learned from the average reader’s advanced history classes, but this novel adds a new dimension to the textbook pages with intense and realistic imagery. The journey down the Congo sets the dangerous setting for interactions with natives and other workers, leading to an easily predictable ending of Marlow meeting Kurtz. However, Kurtz’s untimely death and Marlow’s untruthful delivery of his last words are unforeseen by readers other than myself. This novel is a heavy read and difficult to grasp because of the lack of humanity of all characterized. The native people are portrayed in a heavily critical manner in need of filtering by today’s standards, but like in Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s Herland, those who invade truly opt to make an area their own instead of integrating, also seen by the mistreatment of Native American tribes during the colonization of America.
With all this in mind, I reiterate my strong recommendation of reading this timeless novel. Not only is it praiseworthy in the sense of capturing history in its true and brutal form, but it also has great literary merit, a reason why I will forever keep it peeking out from my satchel. I had seen this title and Conrad's name coined constantly through other mediums before I actually decided to read this. I wasn't really pressed on until I came across a lecture by Chinua Achebe, an African author, who claimed that Heart of Darkness and Conrad were racist. Nothing like some controversy to inadvertently give attention to what your actually protesting eh? His views on Conrad though reminded me of my own on Mark Twain though. I don't like Twain, I think he was a racist despite being hailed constantly by English teachers I've known. I would have thought the same if I hadn't come across his views on American Indians. He called us ""scum of the earth"" and other things. Statements he never retracted apparently. It didn't stop me from reading Twain which I have done but It didn't impress me. So I can actually somewhat understand Achebe's qualms but there turned out to be more to the Heart of Darkness than he would have some believe.

From what I understand this short work is heavily based on Conrad's own experiences from what he saw in the Congo Free State, something that would go on to effect his health and stability as it does for the character of the book Marlow. Marlow is a young man from England. Hungry for adventure on a steam boat in the dark continent. He manages to land a job with a company that is based on the Congo. So now the captain of his own tug boat he goes into Africa only to bare witness to the acts of the corporation he works for. Lines of naked bony natives in chains are led into mine shafts by uniformed men, massive tracts of the jungle are slashed and burned for bits of ivory, while starving slaves are left to die on the banks of the river. If this is progress then humanity is doomed it seems. But Marlow isn't there to gawk instead he's sent down river to track down and find a company agent, Mr Kurtz.

Kurtz seems to be a golden boy of the company. His superiors praise him, so does his family and friends. He is like the embodiment of European ideals, superior in every way to the savages but as Marlowe goes down the river and further into the dark jungles he learns more about this man and his troubling nature. Despite his superior stock and civilized morals Kurtz had quite literally ""gone native"". It can be looked at in various ways. A disturbing indictment of greed and imperialism. A look at the self destructive nature of humanity or civilization in general. While the book was good in the respects of allegory its still very archaic. His writing can drag in certain parts and feels pretty dated. But it's Conrad's depictions of the natives stands out above all of them. They have almost no actual culture, they prance around fires with grass skirts and bones in their noses; and the description of the witch woman feels like it was torn right out of a pulp magazine. Still though I think the themes of the book and overall message trump these bits but some may just find them distasteful.

In the end I actually liked Heart of Darkness but it definitely is racist in some parts. Conrad may have been disgusted with the Congo Free State, he may have been against imperialism, but he still saw the Africans as a lesser people. Still one can't really indict a man on views that were otherwise very common in his time. Compared to others from the same period Conrad was definitely a progressive. The book is pretty powerful and it had a strong message of anti-imperialism before it was beaten to death later on. In the end it's all a matter of taste. I liked it, its well written, not long, and it may dwell in the back of your head for a while. It left me wondering whether or not Kurtz's final message ""exterminate the brutes"" was meant for the natives or mankind in general. El corte de las páginas está pésimo Conrads Meisterwerk in einer sehr guten Neuauflage. Viele Zusatzinformationen, gewohnt hervorragende Penguin-Qualität. by Joseph Conrad

James McCormick's review
Apr 19, 16 · edit

it was amazing
bookshelves: currently-reading

This one had been very high on my to- read- list for a long time. I’ve read several of Conrad’s books previously and also saw an interview where Coppola talked about how it inspired Apocalypse Now. It’s quite a small work, more of a novella than a novel, and when I did finally get down to it - I read it in a single sitting.

The story’s premise is quite simple. Marlow (the first person narrator of the story) travels up the Congo river on his employer’s orders to find and bring back an ivory trader by the name of Kurtz who is for much of the story a mysterious, almost mythical figure, “a prodigy… an emissary of pity and science and progress,"" who inspires awe and devotion in many of those he encounters. By the time Marlow does meet the physically ailing but still impressive, charismatic and eloquent Kurtz, we are eager to learn as much as we can about this human enigma through the more dispassionate and perspicuous eyes of our narrator.

Like all Conrad’s works, the prose reads like dark, brooding blank verse which is utterly compelling. What struck me was the issue of free will. Marlow seems fated to meet the mysterious Kurtz and his journey toward the interior seems inevitable as Marlow is drawn nearer and nearer to the heart of darkness. All the while we have an overpowering sense of paranoia. Nature, represented by the African jungle, is dark, pitiless and terrifyingly savage, full of strange sounds and cannibalistic inhabitants. Yet as we learn about the European traders and their dubious and exploitive methods we find ourselves contrasting so called modern “civilisation” and asking if it is any better. If there is a moral centre to the work I couldn’t find one. Marlow is more of an observer rather than an active protagonist whilst Kurtz seems almost to stand outside of any framework, natural or societal.

As with other Conrad novels, Heart of Darkness has you thinking about the story well after you finish reading. I was so intrigued by Kurtz’s final exclamation that I did some secondary reading. I initially viewed the work as an elaborate allegory, a descending, (increasingly nihilistic) journey but was surprised to learn (as Conrad claims) the story was to a large degree biographical, with ""experience… pushed a little (and only very little) beyond the actual facts of the case.”

Whatever the case, this is a very powerful, visceral work with prose that rightly places it amongst the literary canon. Fatto bene molto bello Ainda não terminei de ler, pois foi para um curso de literatura em inglês."
The Beautiful and Damned (AmazonClassics Edition),"Anthony Patch is the idle heir to a vast fortune. His wife, Gloria, dazzles society with her good looks. Satisfied by privilege and beauty alone, they are beholden only to the “magnificent attitude of not giving a damn.” When Anthony’s inheritance is withheld, it causes an irreparable rift in their marriage, threatening their fragile paradise. Oblivious to their future, he and Gloria have little left to define themselves but their ever-receding pasts.
A bitter critique of the empty pleasures of post–World War I Café Society, The Beautiful and Damned endures not only as a cautionary tale but as a social artifact of the decadent Roaring Twenties.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Beautiful and Damned, this edition of The Beautiful and Damned (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. ""It is seven thirty on an August evening. The windows in the living room of the gray house are wide open patiently exchanging the tainted inner atmosphere of liquor and smoke for the fresh drowsiness of the late hot dusk. There are dying flower scents upon the air, so thin, so fragile, as to hint already of a summer laid away in time.""

This is the story of a young couple Anthony and Gloria Patch living out their days to the hilt in New York City as they await the death of Anthony's grandfather, Adam Patch from whom they expect to inherit his massive fortune.

Gloria is a spoilt child from Kansas City turned into a sophisticated and most beautiful woman. Gloria does not intend to lift a finger to do any domestic work in the home, no matter how slight; while Anthony who considers himself an aesthete, finds it quite hard to get his act together and instead of buckling down to some work, prefers instead to hang with his wife and their friends on nightly binges. They drink and eat in the classiest restaurants and hotels, rent the most expensive apartments, travel out to the West in the spring time driving plush cars, wearing top-of-the-line clothing and just generally living it up high on the hog, as they wait.

Meet Maury Noble who is Anthony best friend who spends his time between New York and Philadelphia; Richard Caramel who has just completed writing a book and looking for new ideas for a second one. Joseph Bloeckman from Munich who started out small in America and is now a big shot in Show Biz. Also the quiet Jewess Rachael Barnes and Muriel Kane who is young, flirtatious and sometimes a bit too talkative and Tana the Japanese housekeeper of the Patches.

We are shown the Patches at their very best as the novel starts, with the world at their feet and loaded with cash with which they make very expensive choices. But, as we get further in, we see things begin to change gradually and we realize that those very choices will be their very downfall. It was quite a good read but it could be very heartbreaking at times as we put ourselves into the shoes of the main characters. All lovers of F. Scott Fitzgerald should read this book if you haven't done so already, and those of you who like reading about the ultra rich in the Roaring Twenties this one is for you. It is the kind of book that you feel you will want to read again. It is that good and I shall miss it.
Reviewed by Heather Marshall Negahdar (SUGAR-CANE 10/04/04) I first read The Beautiful and Damned when I was about fourteen, right after I had read my first Fitzgerald book, The Great Gatsby. And I was, of course, greatly disappointed; this is no Gatsby. I found the novel verbose and dull, and I couldn't relate at all to the two main characters, Anthony and Gloria Patch, a spineless rich boy married to a lazy, domineering, spoiled brat. They must surely be two of the least sympathetic characters in literary history.

Reading this novel again, almost forty years later, I found much more to appreciate about it than I did at first reading, but I finished it with a heavy heart, fervently wishing that a talented editor had taken an entire box of blue pencils to the manuscript.

One of the great literary achievements of ""Gatsby"" is its amazing economy of style; Fitzgerald stuffs an enormous amount of information into a very short book, without once leaving us feeling that something's been left out. (This is probably because Gatsby, alone among Fitzgerald's novels, began its literary life as a novella--a long short story--rather than as a novel. Fitzgerald literally pulled the original novella manuscript out of galley typesetting and expanded it into a novel.)

""Economy of style"" is a description you certainly can't apply to The Beautiful and the Damned; it meanders all over the place, and it employs a hokey and odd literary device by turning some of the dialogue into actual dramatic scenes from a play, rather than prose. This device might have worked if Fitzgerald had used it throughout the book, but he doesn't; he drops the dramatic scenes after the early chapters of the book, and never re-uses them again. That just makes those scenes stand out even more awkwardly amid the regular prose.

The book also suffers very badly from the lack of sympathetic main characters. Of course, the whole point of the plot is that these people are awful, but we need **some** reason to keep reading their story. Again, if an editor had taken out his box of blue pencils, he might have noted on the manuscript that Anthony and (and especially) Gloria needed some kind of sympathetic counter-balance to their general, dual awfulness. Otherwise, why continue reading? There is a slight--very slight--sympathetic air attached to Anthony, whose main redeeming quality is his self-loathing; he knows he is awful and is ashamed of it, but is not strong enough to do anything about it. Gloria, on the other hand, has no clue that she is a greedy, incredibly selfish monster; she thinks her looks are the only thing she needs to offer up to the world in order to obtain all the ""goodies"" to which she feels entitled.

Despite these major flaws, the book is still worth reading for Fitzgerald's matchless prose, some of the prescient philosophizing (he rightly predicts the death of poetry as a literary art form, and for the correct reason, too) and the richly drawn tertiary characters, such as Tana, the Japanese houseboy, and Dot, the tragic Southern camp follower who falls hopelessly in love with Anthony. There is also something to be gained at pondering the lives and personalities of the Patches and realizing that most of us, no matter how flawed we think we are, are much better people than they are. Anthony Patch was a shallow, small-minded, egoistical man.  He was having a damned hard time keeping a goddess wife, Gloria.  He was her slave.  I was amazed, disgusted at Gloria's heartless vanity; why so much beauty should be given to those who made so bad a use of it.
Both of them accustomed themselves to the enjoyment of riches. They considered fortune as necessary everywhere.  As soon as he lost his fortune and funds, he was disgraced, he lost his character, and lost all the few friends he had.

It's very easy to resist temptation, if one wishes. Absolutely gorgeous pocket book! How to describe the entirety of this novel?

Often I will put one or two lines on Goodreads after finishing a book. For The Beautiful and Damned, the lines were as follows:

“What a beautiful and strangely desolate novel. My goodness.”

And The Beautiful and Damned is exactly that. It soars from theatrical beauty and then plummets to cold desolation, to unfolding of horrific emotion. The characters are at once vivid and on the verge of crumbling. The prose, as ever, is delicious, decadent and evocative.

The theatricality comes mainly in the form of Gloria, a shining beacon for the indulgence of the Jazz Age, who delights in the social freedom and seemingly exquisite nature of her life, and who enthrals Anthony Patch, a writer and the narrator of this tale of excess. Within the first few pages of their encounters, it occurred to me that both characters seemed to represent both Scott and Zelda. Once this idea had taken hold, I found it impossible to shake off, and by the time I closed the book on the final page, I was convinced that this was what The Beautiful and Damned was: Scott’s wishful thinking for their life and his bitterness and adoration for his wife poured into a single novel.

Which is heartbreaking, but it makes for a compelling and achingly wistful tale. Admittedly, it took me a good few pages to get into the story – I was waiting for Gloria to appear and ignite the fireworks – but when the lady arrived, I was gripped. I followed every encounter with wide eyes, and I admit that I had no idea how the novel would end, if it would be happy or not. When the end did indeed come, I found the climax very startling, very sudden. Some might argue that it was too sudden, that the novel feels cut off or rushed because of it, but I disagree. It left me shocked, but realising later on that it had been building up to it, with both characters hurtling towards trouble and not knowing how to stop. It was gripping, wonderful, and agonising all at once.

Anyone who knows me will tell you how much I adore Fitzgerald’s style, and The Beautiful and Damned only reinforced this love for his writing. It is a complex exploration of human character, and the heights it goes to are dizzying, as are the sudden falls.

I highly, highly recommend this. I cannot recommend it enough. The Great Gatsby might be considered his masterpiece, but I much prefer the characters in The Beautiful and Damned. They’ve stuck in my head much longer than Gatsby or Daisy Buchanan have.

And that really is saying something. Excelente producto Aún no la he terminado, pero puede que no llegue a terminarla. Si la terminó, cambiaría.la reseña. Lo que puedo decir, de momento, es que no es una lectura para cualquier persona. Yo tenía muchas expectativas puestas en ella, pero de momento se me está haciendo insufrible. Quizá todavía no haya llegado a ""la parte interesante, pero la vida de estos pijos de la época, me aburre hasta más no poder. A ello hay que sumarle la edición que es peor que mala, con una letra no apta para cegatos, que hace que se pierdas y tengas que estar usando el dedito a modo de cursor para seguir línea a línea la historia. En fin, de momento no me está enamorando, pero puede que eso cambie. Y, por favor, señores, ¡a ver si es posible que la próxima edición la pongan a una letra que no sea de 6,5 puntos,!"
The Tell-Tale Heart and Other Stories (AmazonClassics Edition),"Edgar Allan Poe elevated the gothic story, developed the unreliable narrator, recast psychological terror, and reveled in both the horror and the supernal beauty of death. From Poe’s rich, unrivaled imagination comes a collection of his most masterful works, including “The Black Cat,” “The Fall of the House of Usher,” and, of course, “The Tell-Tale Heart.” Each story explores morbid themes of grief, greed, fear, and guilt, and together they embody Poe’s grotesque obsessions—even the dread of being buried alive.
At the beating heart of each of these eighteen tales—and his tour de force in verse, “The Raven”—is proof that Poe can still surprise, shock, unsettle, and hold readers in thrall after more than a century.

Revised edition: Previously published as The Tell-Tale Heart and Other Stories, this edition of The Tell-Tale Heart and Other Stories (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Ask any person to invent a horror story... even if that person is not used to read instinctively will try to set a tone with Poe's voice... so deep is Poe in our minds.

I read Poe since kid, first in Spanish language, then when I decided to learn English an edition of his selected works by Penguin books and a dictionary was my master. Usually English writers in comparison to writers in other languages tend to be clean and direct; Poe, who was rich in many cultures and seems to have read books preferably in their original idiom and it shows: he has a unique style, not always easy but part of his special voice, he is not condescending with the reader so you have to grow to walk with him, because he has a vast culture.

These tales are worldwide famous so it would unnecessary to explain the plots and stories, enough to say that Poe's world is so amazing that sometimes you would like it to be the real one; there is the temptation to not see the real Maelström to save the disappointing of being not like Poe's Maelström. They are complex and evolve to extraordinary conclusions, you can read them many times and still finding more details. I adore how U.S. is a place of marvels and the old world is an exotic place; usually in Spanish language (except the genial Borges) the writers feel that their culture is European and they are here like visitors, instead Poe feels closer because his voice and heart is in his land, there is not nostalgia of other places: he is a truly genius creating something new.

Is interesting that apparently writers of his century thought little of him, those writers are being devoured by oblivion in archaic schools; instead Poe is so powerful, each little tale is so rich that pre-configures whole genres as science-fiction, horror, and detective stories as are known today; his essays materialize in music and architecture. Even more Poe is still present, as the voice that manifest our personal horrors is his. Edgar Allan Poe is the most beloved writer of the English literary canon.
This collection of stories is the most well-written of this author's books. `The Tell-Tale Heart and Other Stories` is a collection of Edgar Allan Poe short stories that showcases the talent of this great Gothic style narrator. The stories are a mix of horror, supernatural, science fiction, mystery, detective work that kept my interest alive as I was reading the book; from my point a view this edition is a well curated eclectic collection.

I personally don't find the style of Edgar Allan Poe too macabre/morbid nor it causes me psychological terror (maybe because I have read more recent and more dark literature). But the stories still capture horror and supernatural, exploring the dark side of human nature. I find Edgar Allan Poe style of writing easy to read, enjoyable, even in the gloomiest tales; still, somehow this doesn't make the reading less powerful, the struggles and the psychological introspects of characters less complex.

While I was familiar with Gothic dark writings such as `The Black Cat` and `The Raven`, I discovered with delight detective work stories such as `The murders in the Rue Morgue`.

I read this book in Kindle format; the reading experience was good on smartphone and Kindle device alike. For over 150 years, Poe has terrorized readers with tales that explore the dark side of the human mind. I prefer those that get into the action immediately such as ""The Tell-Tale Heart"", or "" The Cask of Amontillado"" rather than those in which he ""cogitates"" for several pages, such as ""The Imp of the Perverse"" or ""Murder at the Rue Morgue"". 4 "" dark and dreary"" stars. Super affordable with classic literary works from Edgar Allan Poe KindleUnlimited review. This Amazon Classics edition contains nineteen short stories and poems. Edgar A. Poe’s most well-known writing is here: Tell-Tale Heart, The Black Cat, The Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Fall if the House of Usher, The Pit and the Pendulum, and The Raven. The only thing missing is The Bells poem. I have the Dorset Press book “The complete Tales and Poems of Edgar Allen Poe with selections from his critical writings”. This Kindle Amazon Classics edition has a superb Brilliance Audience Production audiobook that is delightful to hear. I have listen at night before bedtime as Halloween prep. I love Edgar Allan Poe so this book was a great choice, however the book came creased and bent so I didn't enjoy it as much as I would of liked, but overall its was a decent buy This is a good collection of Poe’s works. His intense description—both beautiful and precise— evokes thrilling terror and suspense as he weaves his horrifying tales. Not softened for fear of upsetting the weak Este libro es lo que considero cómo debería ser el libro perfecto: con una encuadernación robusta y meticulosa, un buen papel, un diseño bonito, maravilloso y espectacular y todo esto envuelto en un caramelo literario como son los relatos de Edgar Allan Poe y las inquietante y bellísimas ilustraciones de Harry Clarke. ¿Que más se puede pedir?. Así es como debe ser un libro. Es perfecto. Un 12 de 10. Para esas tardes de relax y días lluviosos y estar tomando un café, té o bebida para amenizar el día Very fine uses of the English language drawing out archaic words that demand concentration, and really gives my mouth a full workout when reading aloud. I find myself thinking about the way in which the author connects deep thought and observation and then expresses this into language. We seem to have lost our intellectual capacity due to the diminishing language skills. Must read more! Review originally posted on The Book Adventures of Annelise Lestrange :)

The Imp of the Perverse

A little like The Tell-Tale Heart, the base of the plot is the guilty that the narrator feels after doing something bad. In this case, the main character murdered another man to inherit his proprieties and, as he was very clever, the police never got him. However, the narrator always feels like he may be caught at any moment and his paranoia is the crux of the problem.

What I thought: My mom gave me a book with 22 stories from Poe some years ago and this one I had already read in the past, but I almost didn’t remember it. It was very nice to feel the thrill that Poe constructs in his writing like it was the first time. This one became one of my favorites <3

Hop Frog or The Eight Chained Ourangoutangs

This is the story of two dwarfs at a king’s court. The male one, Hop Frog, was the court jester and limped a lot. The female one, Tripetta, was a beautiful dwarf, well proportionated and very charming. The two of them bound, as both are slaves of the king, who likes most of all, to mock Hop Frog with his consultants. After a particular unfortunate incident with Tripetta, Hop Frog elaborates a plan to avenge her and punish his king and his consultants.

What I thought: Another one already read and this one I remembered well, as Hop Frog’s plan was audacious, brilliant and cruel. But there was another thing that marked me good: the happy ending. It’s a rarity among Poe’s tales, LOL.

The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar

In this tale, the narrator is a doctor interested in mesmerism, a kind of hypnotism. He’s specially interested in the effects of mesmerism on a dying person, so he is given the chance to test his theories at his dying friend, Mr. Valdemar. Of course, things don’t go as planned.

What I thought: This one also was in my other book, but I totally forgot it. And I have to say I know why: I didn’t like it. It was too much fantasy for Poe’s style, in my opinion :/

The Black Cat

This is the tale of a man who loves animals very much, but an incident with his cat Pluto transforms his conception of reality in a way that drives him insane.

What I thought: I don’t know which is more famous: The Black Cat or The Tell-Tale Heart, LOL. I first read this when I was in junior high and it’s wonderful every time I read again. It’s simply ingenious.

Never Bet the Devil Your Head

Tommy Dammit was the hateful kind of person you want to punch in the face. His friend, the narrator, tries during the whole story to bring him to the “good” side, but Tommy won’t go for it. The result is that, after so many bets to the devil, Tommy finally delivers the so-promised prize.

What I thought: this one was new for me, as it wasn’t present on my other book. It was very interesting, specially the way of how the narrator’s thoughts changes during the tale, but wasn’t anything breathtaking. I guess, when you know a bit or two about Poe, some kinds of plots become a little foreseeable. Anyway, it’s worth the reading :)

The Murders in the Rue Morgue

The tale that names the book presents us to Mr. Dupin, a very intelligent man who uses his observation powers to solve a murder case that even the police considered a lost cause.

What I thought: Dupin is Poe’s French version of Sherlock Holmes. He’s very talented, intelligent and eccentric, just like Sherlock, but a little more insane, if you ask me. I didn’t know this one too and it was amazing how things are so not what they look like. It’s now in my heart, along with The Black Cat, William Wilson, The Tell-Tale Heart and Berenice <3 <3

That’s all, folks! Thank you for reading!"
Gulliver's Travels (AmazonClassics Edition),"Lemuel Gulliver, English surgeon turned ship captain, embarks on four fantastic voyages, each a clash with strange beings and cultures—from the eccentric to the odious. Island by island, he meets the savage but tiny Lilliputians, the hideous Yahoos, a stable of talking horses, a race of decrepit immortals, and the ghosts of Julius Caesar and Homer.
A parody of the popular seafaring narratives of his time, a harsh judgment against inherently corrupt human nature, and a satire of the ways of England, Swift’s masterpiece was written “to vex the world rather than divert it.” For generations, it has inspired it.

Revised edition: Previously published as Gulliver’s Travels, this edition of Gulliver’s Travels (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Gulliver's Travels is such a great classic that it is difficult to write any sort of regular review. So instead I have compiled a list of observations.
Isaac Asimov, the distinguished writer, scientist, and Sci-fi buff, speculates that the made-up languages in Gulliver's Travels are basically nonsense; then he turns around and speculates that Lilliput is a corruption of ""little bit"". Good guess! - but maybe it's ""little part"" or ""little pint""? Asimov also gives a other cases where highly plausible decipherments can be made.
Interestingly, Swift's made-up languages often have a definite Italian ring. Swift himself says so much when commenting on the language of Laputa. Did Swift have a particularly admiration for Italian? Did he study it?
It is usually assumed that most events and characters in Gulliver are veiled satires on England, and its misrule of Ireland. Perhaps. But maybe Swift was also poking fun at the Italian states. The ""good old days"" for which Swift pined may then be those of the Roman empire.
It is often claimed that the fourth book is the best, and the third book the weakest. I disagree! Possibly from a purely stylistic standpoint the fourth book, on the horse-people, IS the best. But this is not enough to make it the most interesting. The Houyhnhnms represent Swift's idea of purely rational, benign beings. They don't lie, and have virtually no crime. But frankly, they are boring! They appear to have neither dreams nor aspirations, and little imagination. They spend much of their time in busy-work - apparently so as to stay out of trouble, in the manner of certain monastic orders. Perhaps the real trouble is that humans have a limited capacity for imagining perfect goodness. Look at the divine comedy triptych painted by Bosch. Which is the most interesting panel? The one on heaven? I don't think so!
The third book (the one about the flying island of Laputa) contains a wealth of ideas - even if hastily written. Asimov points out that, unlike the other books, in the third book Swift takes considerable pains to explain ""the marvelous"" in scientific terms -- at least to the extent such explanations are possible. This is a hallmark of science fiction, as opposed to fantasy. A strong case can be made for Swift as the first true sci-fi writer. Consider, for example, his amazingly prophetic description of the two moons of Mars.
Here is another example of Swifts amazing prescience. It is from Laputa, and illustrates the major concerns of Laputa's scientists:
""These people are under continual Disquietudes, never enjoying a minutes Peace of Mind; and their disturbances proceed from causes which very little effect the rest of Mortals. ... That, the Earth very narrowly escaped a Brush from the last Comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to Ashes; and that the next, which they have calculated for One and Thirty years hence, will probably destroy us.""
Don't we incessantly hear about the grave dangers comets and asteroids pose to us? Great satirical story. Now I know where to term YAHOO comes from and I think the forth voyage was the most interesting although the Liliputians is the one most known.
Somewhat difficult following the old English but well worth it. As a student I remember that I loved this story very much. My old penguin edition had been lost. So bought it again for my children. You can't really review a book like Gulliver's Travels the way you might review a similar book written three hundred years later. Of course, you *could*, and focus on the plot, the characters, the themes and prose style and that sort of thing, but it would be missing the point. Those elements aren't why Gulliver's Travels is famous, or widely read, or influential. (If you want such a review though, the thumbnail version is that the plot is functional, the characters embody the satirical purpose for which they were designed and no more, and the prose is standard eighteenth-century stuff, occasionally venturing into parodies of 18th century prose, which are not easy for the untrained eye to distinguish. Some of the episodes, such as Gulliver kidnapped by a monkey, are amusing, and I am never able to think of soft-boiled eggs without thinking of Catholics and Protestants. On the other hand, this *is* the 18th century, and there are a wearying number of jokes about excrement.)

Instead, there are two main elements to think about. First, the effect that Gulliver's Travels had on the future of literature, both in a broad sense -- along with lesser Swift works, it essentially launched the genre of satire, which is still a vibrant etc. -- and more narrowly. References to Lilliput and Brobdingnag and the Yahoos and that sort of thing are some of the puzzle pieces that Western literature is made out of. If you want to understand them, or make erudite conversation, this would probably be a good book to read, regardless of its literary merits (Advanced readers should be warned that this familiarity is a double-edged sword: Nobody knows what Struldbrugs or Glubbdubdrib are, so don't bother bringing them up.)

Also worth consideration is what Gulliver's Travels says about English society in 1726. And here, I'm sorry to say, the answer is, ""not as much as Swift thinks it does."" His complaints about Georgian England are veiled in allegory in the first parts, and devolve into naked rants as the novel progresses. And what sort of things does Swift complain about? The national debt is a favorite topic; the dishonesty of politicians and lawyers, the idiocy of professors and ""projectors"", the decay of a glorious past, and sexual immorality.

It could be Swift's influence as a social critic, if you want to look at it that way, but you can read this stuff anywhere. You could hear it on AM radio right now, for heaven's sake. And if you're reading Gulliver's Travels to learn how society 300 years ago differed from our own, well, consider this book evidence for the null hypothesis. A historia te faz refletir sobre sua posição na sociedade/natureza abordando diferentes óticas.
Não é tão emocionante, mas reflexiva.
Livro em ótimo estado. C'est un des romans classiques anglais.
Ce livre est de la collection Oxford World's Classic.
Je l'avais lu en français. Je le lis en anglais et j'en tire beaucoup plus d'avantage. Parce que je suis plus attentif. Quien esté en ""upper-intermediate"" probablemente encontrará dificultades con el vocabulario, pues tendrá que tirar de diccionario a menudo... aparte de ello (y del segundo prólogo, que firma un tal Sr. Gulliver, que es rarito rarito, supongo que porque usa intencionadamente un lenguaje enrevesado propio de las 'formalidades' de la época), es una delicia leer este clásico. Muy recomendable What great read!! Wonderful satirical luck at the state of modern human civilisation. Stands the test of time and picks apart the set up of governments and imperial powers. Describes all the strange ways in which Humans hurt themselves and each other in a very engaging manner. Swift indeed."
Dubliners (AmazonClassics Edition),"In exploring everyday life and its intersections with death, this enduring collection of stories offers a naturalistic depiction of the working class in early twentieth-century Dublin. Joyce masterfully portrays frustrations and aborted desires to escape the mundane; transformative epiphanies both great and small; and the restraints, loneliness, violence, and contemplations of lives lived.
Though Joyce’s subjects were considered as taboo as his language was unsavory, Dubliners was a milestone work praised for its unflinching realism. It remains a transcendent and relatable portrait of the perils—and acceptance—of the human condition.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Dubliners, this edition of Dubliners (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Just finished The Dubliners by James Joyce. I hadn’t read any of his works. This is a good start for anyone thinking of reading real literature. It’s astonishing to think he was 22 years old when he’d completed these stories. But I guess true genius shows up early. I see why he is so revered. I would like to learn the art of short story writing and Joyce is the master.

This book is a series of vignettes, snapshots or sketches. Just the ticket for those who want a brief read before turning out the light, perhaps. But all the stories have a streak of sadness and harsh reality of those years before World War I, so your dreams may not be so sweet. There are fifteen stories but I will refer to just three.

I loved THE BOARDING HOUSE. This covers the life of the boarding house owner, Mrs. Mooney and her daughter Polly. Polly starts a dalliance with one of the boarders—thirty-five-year-old, Mr. Doran—a man with a fairly good job—a decent catch. Madam will deal with matters of emotion ‘like a cleaver to meat’, as Joyce delicately puts it, especially where her daughter’s honor is at stake. No man would be allowed to abuse her hospitality and get away with it under her own roof. Like Polly, now sullied, Mr. Doran stands to lose everything.

ARABY is one of my favorites and tells the story of a boy who falls for the girl across the street, the sister of a friend. He is obsessed with her and she fills his thoughts for every moment, at school, at home. He sits by the parlor window staring at her door across the street. Love is painful. This story is relevant to all of us at that age as boys and girls who become smitten. Puppy love. Eventually the girl speaks to him under the lamp light. He notices every detail about her. Joyce describes the light on her body and her petticoat. She tells him she would love to go the Araby market on Saturday, but she has to go to a church meeting. Thrilled, the boy tells her he is going and will bring her something back. He now has a mission and a reason to get closer to her. He counts the hours until he can go after getting permission from his aunt and promise of money from his uncle. Frustratingly, his uncle comes home late that Saturday evening and has forgotten about his promise. His aunt persuades him to give him the money and let him go. Joyce describes the lonely train journey to the bazaar. He’s been given a florin (two shillings—about twenty-five cents in today’s money) and spends most of it on the train fare and a shilling to get in. Once inside, most of the stalls are now closed. Deflated, he stares at a stall with jars and things and the girl who he’d heard talking with two men asks him if he wants to buy something. He tells her ‘no’. Most of his money is gone now. He notices the accents of the girl and two men are English. Why? It just is. And it makes it all the more real. He storms out feeling angry with himself for what he realizes is a fool’s errand, for his stupidity and pride—one of those coming-of-age moments in a young man’s life.

Joyce makes the complex look simple. He does not explain anything and leaves somethings as a mystery. Why does he mention that they live in a house where a priest had died? Why does the boy live with his uncle and aunt? Where are his mother and father? We must presume they are dead. That is how things are in the boy’s life. And that’s how the best writing is. Things left unexplained.

These are stories like beautifully prepared simple meals. Every bite, every word, delicious. Of course, simple meals aren’t always so simple. Often preparation is complex, resulting in exquisite, memorable taste.

THE DEAD is reckoned to be one of Joyce’s masterpieces and John Huston filmed it beautifully and showed his own genius. The main character, Gabriel, takes his wife to a Christmas celebration at the house of his two aunts with many in attendance. Later that night, he takes his wife home by carriage in the snow and all the while he is feels his love for her, as he’d done all evening, and looks forward to making love to her at their hotel room. Once there, and after chatting with her, he realizes she is distraught. He learns of a previous love she had had for a boy she’d known when she was young and who had died, or willed himself to die when she left to live in another town. Gabriel’s own sadness and crushed spirit are evident as, with tears in his eyes, he looks out into the gently falling snow that must be falling on his wife’s sweetheart’s grave and across all of Ireland. The last paragraphs are said to be some of the greatest writing in English literature. John Huston’s excellent film maybe viewed on Youtube.

On looking back over The Dubliners, I have to ask myself: are these stories and Joyce’s writing so impactful that they could change how you think? Yes, I think so. I’ll read them again and again. The more one delves, the more one sees. It’s not really so much about the dreary lives of people Joyce writes about, but about the writing itself that conjures up emotional experience. Dubliners is more of a collection of character sketches than short stories, but as a whole can be taken as a tale of Joyce’s Dublin in the early nineteenth century. Some pieces are quite short – almost flash fiction by today’s standards – some resonate with poignancy, whereas others feel vague and underdeveloped. One or two were considered risqué for the time and were almost removed but Joyce prevailed and got them published. His ability to convey sensitive subject matter for his time is remarkable and, in the stronger pieces, he is able to depict character with a deft detail or two. Oddly enough I found the longest piece – which takes up almost a quarter of the book – to be the least satisfying, cluttered with superficial banter and too many characters. But overall, Joyce’s use of close third person for inner monologue – revolutionary when this book was written – stands the test of time and makes Dubliners well worth reading. This was my introduction to James Joyce. I thought that a collection of short stories would hold my interest (they did) and that I would gain insight into the work of a celebrated author (which I did). I found the book well-written, and the characters were fleshed out and interesting.

On a personal note, I had a lot of trouble getting through the book. I have been slowly wading through “Dubliners” for four months, reading a story and then setting the book down and picking it up weeks later and reading another story. I finally “bit the bullet” and read the final eleven stories over the last few days. While Joyce certainly achieved his goal of presenting stories of introspective characters, a whole book of people who are realizing they are not who they thought they were is one full book of misery.

So even though the stories are excellently crafted, I didn’t particularly enjoy reading it. There is a dash of negativity in each story that just doesn’t sit well in my cup of tea…or my pint of Guinness. Still, one has to appreciate good work. Five stars. If you want to read something that does not create any conscious emotions in you, this book is a good one. It is not a book that I just can't put down, to feel a need to continue reading.
It is not a book that will actually learn you something new. I don't find the described persons any different from those living in any city or village all over the world. The personages are just too flat for me. #macmillan Collector's Library Edition :
Alike all Booklovers I have a common interest of exploring different kinds of edition.well,I found this 'Macmillan Collector's Library' edition a year ago and bought one for a mere experiment and oh my God ! it's a tiny little pastle-colored hardcover edition that's look really cute😍. Now I've two books of this edition(Dubliners by James Joyce & A Midsummer Night's Dream by william Shakespeare).All books of this edition come with this same kind of sky blue(as I don't know the exact name of this shade😝)and golden colored dust cover( and underneath the cover the same sky blue shade Clothbound, carved with some floral designs) .

Now it's time to peek inside the book and as you open it you'll find two beautiful pastle-colored leafy printed pages before & after the text which I love the most 😍.The quality of the bright white pages with golden shiny edges are good enough and the glossy ribbon is an addition to the beauty of the book. You can carry books of this edition anytime anywhere.

The only flaw of this edition is it's small fonts. But I can consider that, it's an adorable chhotu edition .❤ .#macmillancollectorslibrary My opinion is the following. First you must read the Dubliners and then Ulysses. I first read Ulysses (with a lot of annotations) and after that T read the Dubliners. Nowadays I understand better the characters who both appear in Dubliners and Ulysses. It seems to me easier to catch the psychology concerning these characters because the short stories/tales in Dubliners allow me to understand and remember better the actions and the life as concerns the characters. thank you very much. Edizione integrale in lingua originale. Note ben scritte a pie' di pagina. In fondo al libro esercizi e domande di comprensione per ogni capitolo. Sono presenti alcune illustrazioni in bianco e nero. All'inizio breve biografia dell'autore, cronologia dei punti salienti della sua vita e interpretazione e temi delle storie.

"The Brothers Grimm: Illuminated Fairy Tales, Vol. 1 [Kindle in Motion]","From “Rapunzel” to “Hansel and Gretel,” Grimm’s Fairy Tales have enchanted readers for generations. This dramatic Kindle in Motion edition presents seven classic stories—each restored to its original version and reimagined with modern digital illustrations.
Each tale is lovingly portrayed by a different artist: Kali Ciesemier’s vibrant colors animate the thorny path of “Briar Rose.” The sinister course of “Hansel and Gretel” takes a twist in the candy hues of Peter Diamond. Daniel Krall’s richly detailed line work shines amid the wickedly dark “The Juniper-Tree.” Nicolas Rix’s charming storybook style delights in “The Frog-Prince or Iron Henry.” Ashley Mackenzie’s golden tones light up the ball in “Cinderella.” Horses, ducks, and birds turn macabre in Wesley Allsbrook’s wildly gestural portrayal of “The White Snake.” And Rapunzel lets down her hair in Rovina Cai’s hauntingly beautiful drawings.
Experience the iconic classics you know and love, lavishly illustrated to breathe new life into age-old tales. The stories are well known, Rapunzel, Cinderella and more classic fairy tale and folk tales. It was interesting to compare these to what I remembered of the stories. I found it a little more violent than the versions I heard growing up but not as shockingly so as I’d always been led to believe Grimm could be.

The animated illustrations really steal the show here. Each story is illustrated by a different artist and the choices were wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed immersing myself in this book! Gorgeous illustrations but my kindle reader can’t handle the resolution, it keeps crashing with each animation. Fun to look at otherwise. Such beautiful illustrations for these tales. It’s too bad more of the Brothers Grimm’s stories do not have the same. Loved them. I liked the stories but my Kindle version was supposed to have illustrations which were not available on my paperwhite or my Kindle for pc reader. I bought this book just to see the illustrations. Though, of course, different than the Disney versions we are used to the originals have their charms, too. Lessons as well. Happy endings. A bit gruesome at points, but classics. The ""in motion"" part was okay. Better in some parts than others. It is a great book I thought it was a little bit harder to understand than I would have liked so warning to people not great with this problem but otherwise it was great The illustrations in this book are beautiful. I love the way they move. This is the first Kindle in motion I have read and I can say I was definitely impressed. Such a good short read. I loved the fairy tales collected in this book. Many of them were familiar from the movies and musical adaptations, from Disney and elsewhere. But reading the original versions from the Brothers Grimm brings the reader back to their origins, or as near as we can get. The illustrations accompanying the stories are beautiful, especially when they begin to move. The Kindle in Motion technology helps bring the stories to life and make the experience of reading even more enjoyable."
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (AmazonClassics Edition),"In 1866, sightings of a legendary sea monster prompt a daring expedition out of New York City. Professor Pierre Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and whaler Ned Land are among the crew of the United States Navy frigate Abraham Lincoln. Though they are fearless, nothing prepares them for the “creature” itself—the Nautilus—a powerful, destructive submarine years ahead of its time. At the helm of the vessel is the brilliant Captain Nemo, who pulls the men deep into the wonders of the seas and the dark depths of his mind.
Regarded as one of the great adventure novels of all time, Jules Verne’s prophetic masterpiece, republished here in Lewis Page Mercier’s translation, is at once an enthralling underwater quest and a tale of isolating madness.
Revised edition: Previously published as Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, this edition of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. KindleUnlimited. If you have only watched the Disney movie from 1954, the Jules Verne classic is a must read. There are many more adventures not depicted in the movie. Written in the style of a 19th century travelogue, this fictional tale seems factual. The mysterious Captain Nemo and devoted crew travers the world’s oceans in his fantastic submarine, the Nautilus, Don’t expect any revelations about Captain Nemo’s identity; read Verne’s Mysterious Island for that. I was immediately gripped by this well illustrated tale. As I have gotten older it has been increasingly difficult to find engaging comic book art and stories. This is one of the best I have read recently. The art work is reminiscent of Franklin Booth. I suspect it is pen and ink on scratchboard and the artist has gone in afterward and scratched out some of the line work which gives the work a moody, old-world feel. There are several full page illustrations and they are beautifully rendered. Overall the book has a nice steam punk vibe, befitting since Jules Verne was practically the inventor of the genre (although I have heard that this author is the actual source: Frank Reade: Adventures in the Age of Invention). One favorite panel about 1/4 of the way into the book is of the Nautilus with several cross sections. The pacing of the panels is nice, retaining a traditional feel, but with a lot more diversity than the classic six panels per page. Gianni has done an excellent job staging and pacing the action.

My only criticism is that the story ends rather abruptly, but that is the mostly the fault of Verne. But it did occur to me that maybe the action could have been stretched a bit. The color is adequate. I might have preferred to have seen more warm and cool color contrasts, which could have been included and still preserved the vintage look. But the color certainly doesn't detract from the story.

In addition to the main story there is a four page introduction by Ray Bradbury that is obviously recycled from another edition. I would have preferred an intro by the artist or even the colorists as Bradbury's writing doesn't add much to this edition. At the end of the book is an eight page story by H. G. Wells that is illustrated in chapter book format. The nine illustrations are well done but I haven't read the text as yet (the design reminds me of the illustrated version of Sherlock Holmes).

In short this volume is a great entertainment value that I highly recommend. I can still remember reading 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA for the first time as a kid. I was fascinated by submarines and captivated by the story of this wonderful ship, capable of making all my dreams come true. I wanted to dive beneath the waves and accompany Professor Aronnax on his incredible journey. Reading it again after many years, I find that I am still impressed by the story. Not only is it quite prophetic for its day & age, the fact that the story is STILL captivating after all these years just goes to show that great literature is timeless. In what follows, my comments shall refer to the Bantam version of the novel, translated by Anthony Bonner. This translation (or another suitably modern translation) is critical to getting the most out of this novel, as I will touch upon later.

There is something for everyone in this book. On the one hand, the reader is treated to a very scientific (at times, ""too"" scientific for many readers) tale of undersea exploration, mixed with a tale of adventure and intrigue. The Nautilus carries us to every ocean of the world, exploring the South Pole, the lost city of Atlantis, shipwrecks, a mysterious tunnel between the Arabian and Mediterranean seas, and so much more. On the other hand, Jules Verne has also managed to flesh out a human story, one focused on Captain Nemo and his mysterious past and hatred for Western civilization. While the ""kid"" in you will have your eyes fixed on the Nautilus's glass portal that reveals the wonders of the deep, the ""adult"" in you will be rapidly trying to figure out exactly ""who"" this captain is and why he has built this ship, capable of removing him permanently from society.

Many have complained about Verne's tendency to lose the story for endless lists of scientific classification. It is not hard to see their point. Verne does go on and on about species of fish in a manner that loses the reader's interest after a short while. But there is nothing to prevent you from skimming over these passages and moving onto the story. That's what I do and I don't think I've sacrificed a thing in doing so. Moreover, I would recommend that you keep an atlas or wold map handy when you are reading. It is much more fun to read this novel if you can actually track where they are at each point in the novel.

Those coming to this novel from the movies will either be happily impressed or disappointed. While the films borrow heavily from the novel, they tend to focus on certain elements of the story (enhancing the action) while forgetting about others. This is not the tale of a madman, destined to hunt and destroy ever ocean-going vessel he comes across. It is so much more than that. In fact, my only complaint (and I have similar complaints for many authors) is that Verne seems to have been at a loss for how to end the novel. Therefore, he hands us a ""deus ex machine"" ending, of gigantic proportions. However, despite this minor flaw, the novel still holds up to modern scrutiny and remains enjoyable throughout.

While this translation is much, much better than the cheap translations you find from the ""bargain"" publishing houses, I have heard that the recent, fully-annotated version is even better. Make sure that, when searching for a copy, that you get one of the modern translations (like the Bonner) and stay away from ""quick & dirty"" versions that you can find for a couple of dollars. Many of these cheap translations omit a full quarter of the novel and contain numerous errors. Additionally, they render the French into archaic English, ensuring that you will not enjoy the novel as much as you could. So, my advice is to stay away from the ""bargain"" versions-they aren't a bargain at all. But do read 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA. You'll be happy you did. Seller is very responsive. Fast shipping. The book was packaged well. Thank you. Will consider them again for future purchases. A travel diary (imaginary) informed in incredible detail (at times too much detail) by then known and understood science. But more than that a human story as we come to know more about Captain Nemo. An interesting insight into the engineering and science of the mid 1800s. 状態もきれいで良かったです！ This was a good read. I enjoyed it to the fullest. It was like, I myself was on this underwater tour of the world on Captain Nemo's submarine. The book is worthy of being called a true classic. This can also be a perfect gift to a young kid who enjoys reading. A light and easy read with loads of information about the ocean and earth's geography. I kept consulting my map for various places that the author talks about and kept Googling for different fishes that the author mentioned. A perfect enjoyable read.

Also, the quality of the pages and the binding of the book is good for the price point. The book is very small, I should have searching more about that, because it have ONLY 56 pages! However, the figures is very beautiful, what turns to be out of great help to those one who want a immersive visual experience. This story is one of the classics and for those ready for the journey one that is certainly worth a read.
A word of warning to those thinking that is resembles a Walt Disney film, the book is far more of a biologist saga rather than an outright adventure although it is that too.
Very prophetic in so many technical ways even when compared with to today.
Most people know that basic story and it is of course a great one."
Self-Reliance and Other Essays (AmazonClassics Edition),"In this definitive collection of essays, including the poignant title essay “Self-Reliance,” Ralph Waldo Emerson expounds on the importance of trusting your soul, as well as divine providence, to carve out a life. A firm believer in nonconformity, Emerson celebrates the individual and stresses the value of listening to the inner voice unique to each of us—even when it defies society’s expectations.
Self-Reliance and Other Essays is the perfect companion for those who have marched to the beat of a different drummer and wish to better understand the transcendentalist leader’s groundbreaking philosophy to find personal fulfillment.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from iconic authors. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or revisit an old favorite, these new editions open the door to the stories and ideas that have shaped our world.
Revised edition: Previously published as Self-Reliance and Other Essays, this edition of Self-Reliance and Other Essays (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Great book. The many different essays were a delight to read. Reading literature from earlier times gives us insight of where we've been and where we're going His thinking helps stretch my mind. As I reread his words in this edition, I was again inspired. One of my favorite of his essays, Over soul, was not included. But I was glad to reread TBE ones chosen. Lately, I have taken a renewed interest in Ralph Waldo Emerson. I have read several of his essays, quotes and poems in the past but I had not read this 117 pages Dover thrift edition (Self-Reliance and other essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson) which I purchased on Amazon for a bargain price. I have also ordered other volumes by Emerson at this time.

I was pleased with the quick delivery service. I found this to be a fantastic collection of six essays and one address that I loved reading. The insight and brilliance of Emerson shines in this volume.
The essays (from 1841) in this volume includes: History, self-reliance, friendship, and over-soul. From Essays: second series (1844) the poet, experience and the Divinity School address. The very small print does make this book a little hard to read even with reading glasses. I also have a little trouble with Emerson's style of writing; nevertheless, I found this book to be a wonderful read.

If you are interested in an interesting and historical important writer, philosopher and poet you may want to check out this volume and other writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson.
Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Zen Poetry Moments: Haiku and Senryu for special occasions). Have not read this yet Faulkner’s quip is often held to refer to the American South; a land where the sense of history and tradition run so deep that we are still solving the problems of the 1870s.

But it might also be said of Emerson. He was dismissive of the rote education of his day, which emphasized learning dead languages, along with the dates and biographies of notable persons. What he wanted instead was a living absorption of history.

Confident that every man has the capacity to be a Caesar within him, the reader of the Commentaries should feel immersed in the courage, temperance and leadership of the Roman general. Similarly, we might read the life of Antony to understand moral purity or Washington to learn the virtues of a modern Cincinnatus.

In the penultimate essay Emerson goes so far as to say that Aristotle, Charlemagne and the Buddha are not dead but live on by our continual participation in their spirit.

And, while our materialist age may be dismissive of Transcendentalism, even Einstein was moved by the fact that the laws of physics are true whether time runs forward or backward to utter,
“People like us who believe in physics know that the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”

Who of us can really answer the child’s question of where the past goes? Is Emerson actually irrational in holding on to the continual influence, the persistence of the living past on our present? Questions to ponder as one reads arguably the most elegant stylist of nineteenth century America.

I’ve only touched upon the many insights Emerson offers in these essays. My one regret is that I didn’t read them when I was younger. Highly recommended. I needed a palette cleanser & wanted to read something meaningful, but classic. The transcendentalist came to mind! If you are into any form of self discovery, nature, and looking within, this sub genre is so fun to read & research. It is not that I didn’t understand the essays. For me it was boring. It seemed to me that all of the essays could have rolled into three or four with the same word count equal to one. It was well written and provides a good look into one’s vocabulary. Recommend Found this book hard to get through. This book, especially the essay self reliance has brought a profound change in me. If you are some one who is very innocent or naive, this book will be your life saver. The language is a bit tough. Trust me, read at least the essay self reliance regardless of it's language and you'll thank me. You'll no more be a socital sheep blinded by superstitious beliefs. Self Reliance will make you listen to your inner divinity rather than going through any religious book. It is sure to change your way of thinking. The message is very much needed for us to believe in ourselves. A truly great read, total eye opener. At times, it was like the book knew I was reading it and was telling me what I needed to know...!! This book is a classic - opens your mind to new ideas and breaking social barriers. Perfect for anyone who wants to break outside the norms.

(This published copy however is not beautiful, the material/finished product is of low quality) Non ho trovato gli altri essays molto interessanti. Tuttavia self reliance è di una brillantezza unica. Manifesto dell'individualismo americano e di altri principi e valori intrinsechi alla cultura a stelle e strisce. Chi ha la possibilità di leggerlo in lingua originale, ne vale lo sforzo anche per chi magari fatica con un testo del genere"
Orthodoxy (AmazonClassics Edition),"After the success of Heretics, G. K. Chesterton was challenged and compelled to share the story of his pilgrimage to faith. The result is this bracing, watershed religious autobiography in which he follows the doctrines determined in the Apostle’s Creed to deliver a personal, yet universal, defense of Christianity. Ultimately, the literary giant answers the question—not of whether divinity can be believed—but rather, how he himself came to believe it.
One of the twentieth century’s most influential works, Chesterton’s dynamic and oftentimes sharply witty testimony remains a masterpiece of Christian apologetics.
Revised edition: Previously published as Orthodoxy, this edition of Orthodoxy (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I have read almost 4 books by G. K. Chesterton thus far; and Orthodoxy is a masterpiece. The best of what I have read from him yet. Witty, hilarious, intellectually astute--Chesterton is in fine form throughout. And though Orthodoxy is heady you will find that Chesterton's humor and skill with the pen makes it an almost addictive read. His paradoxical manner of framing big ideas, his undeniable ability to wield ""common"" sense as a weapon, his way of speaking to universal human experiences--together makes him one of the most enjoyable writers of his time. And he's not pulling any punches with the philosophers of his day either.

In the introduction, Chesterton self-deprecatingly describes himself as a man who sent out from England to explore new lands, but gets blown off course in his travels and unknowingly arrives back in downtown London--where he then proceeds to claim this ""new land"" for England! Chesterton then charts his spiritual journey from agnosticism to Christianity and how he unknowingly discovered this ""new doctrine"" on his own--only to find out, much to his surprise, that it was nothing more than the old Christian doctrine which has been believed for thousands of years. Chesterton is a late comer to the party, and he doesn't mind admitting that fact throughout!

Chesterton rails against intellectualism--against the scholastics and against the George Bernard Shaw types. The atheist scientist who says there is no transcendent meaning to this thing called life. Grown up skeptics and modernized ""experts"" who care little for the world. In short Chesterton realizes that the fairy tales that he knew as a child, that wonder he felt within the deepest part of him when he was young, the feeling that the grass was green because it was ""supposed to be green""--were actually all true. The reason the tales of the lady and the dragon, or jack and the beanstalk resonated with him so much as a child because they spoke to a certain human truth--an internal testimony, that there is something more than just molecules and chance. There had to be something more. So Chesterton figures out an understanding of original sin, of creation, of a transcendent God, and of the archetypal tale because it was really true--the story of God coming into the world to bring man back to Himself. Chesterton is unabashedly romantic, and he rejoices to find that Christianity is as well.

In the chapter that perhaps hit me the hardest (The Flag of the World), Chesterton confronts exactly what our posture as Christians needs to be towards the world. It cannot be escapism or pessimism; an unhealthy desire to withdraw from the darkness of the world: ""For our Titanic purposes of faith and revolution, what we need is not the cold acceptance of the world as a compromise, but some way in which we can heartily hate and heartily love it. We do not want joy and anger to neutralize each other and produce a surly contentment; we want a fiercer delight and a fiercer discontent. We have to feel the universe at once as an ogre' castle, to be stormed, and yet as our own cottage, to which we can return at evening."" Wow. That is romance in writing--and ointment to my own personal numbness. Another one: ""The point is not that this world is too sad to love or too glad not to love; the point is that when you do love a thing, its gladness is a reason for loving it, and its sadness a reason for loving it more."" ""A man's friend leaves him as he is: his wife loves him and is always trying to turn him into somebody else.""

This is a great book, and I am already doing a second pass through it because there is so much in it that I missed. Chesterton is medicinal to the ills of a modern world--and Orthodoxy in particular has lost no degree of relevance in the century that has past since its composition. ""The steps a man takes, since the day of his birth till his death, draw in the time an inconceivable figure. The Divine Intelligence intuits immediately that figure, in the same way the men intuit a triangle (...)"" these words are in a little footnote of an essay by Borges, many years ago. Chesterton, nor any human being, has not that infinite intelligence, but after reading Orthodoxy I think he goes well beyond the intelligence of most persons, I believe he can discover the difficult philosophies in history and perceive their pattern and essence as easily as a man can intuit a triangle or a circle. This is my review of what I felt. Is awe-inspiring.

Orthodoxy is a kind of biography but of ideas, actually each page is like a natural paradise full of ideas and thoughts, I enjoyed reading it bit by bit until feel I was reading with understanding (my intelligence is not as vast as Chesterton's powerful creativity). This primal garden is so different than to the irreal excess of philosophers, reading them is like seeing vast forests made of only one tree, or feverish labyrinths of thought, marvelous and complex explanations, but devoid of reality and full of ego; or even worse many times philosophy ends being a philosopher commenting for and about other philosophers. Chesterton in that aspect is superior: he is not naive nor credulous. He read and he has life experience, heart and reasoning, he can talk about philosophies but he does from a place I feel real. I am not Catholic (although I admire the institution of the Catholic church), this book cannot convert me because I am from another continent and culture; but definitively I understand why Chesterton converted to Catholicism. I appreciate him even more for that, I think rather than inherit religions is better for the spirit if each person would awaken by own means to a religion or belief. The only another author that has made me feel the same as Chesterton with this book (I don't recall how many I have read) is Augustine of Hippo, another converse to the Catholic Church, he had that complete conversion too, not only of heart, or mind, but as a complete human being.

The AmazonClassics Edition is, for this book, possibly the best around. There is the useful X-Ray for the many names mentioned, and for those that not there is the built-in option of Wikipedia. The formatting is professional and exemplary. The typography is clean and modern. All in all is very comfortable to read, but what makes it invaluable to me is that there is no introductions, studies, footnotes or any interference by sages or intellectuals, as I want to read a book and think by myself. In that aspect these editions are the best in Kindle. There is only a respectful short biography at the end. Choosing this edition you are reading a flawless edition that feels as fresh as the day it was published. Como Chesterton no hay dos -y como este libro, tampoco. Es fascinante cómo el autor logra guiar al lector por planteamientos e ideas que nadie más ha narrado de una manera tan sublime y artística como él. Cada dos o tres párrafos Chesterton tiene el don de decir una frase inolvidable o una cita extremadamente persuasiva. Uno de los libros más estimulantes que he leído, sin duda.
La apologética de Chesterton -si se le puede llamar así- es única, nadie aborda los temas como él. Este libro no demuestra el cristianismo como tal, sino que defiende el sentido común y termina por llevarte por una travesía aventuresca que te deja con ganas de empezar a aprender sobre la religión tan fascinante desde la que el autor miraba el mundo. Inolvidable libro, inolvidable estilo. Chesterton spends the first 1/3 of the book dismantling the arguments against religion. Then spends the rest of the book building a case for religion in a logical step by step manner that can only be described as brilliant.
Very impressed by the book, there are also a lot of really great quoteable lines.

“Men did not love Rome because she was great, Rome was great because men loved her.” What an amazing read! One of my best book purchases of the year. Every paragraph was filled with wisdom and intellect. One of the best book in defense of Catholic Orthodoxy. The criticism that Chesterton makes of materialism and scientific dogma is very witty and ingenious. It is amusing also to realize how little the arguments and worldview of the “moderns” have changed in 100 years!
Chesterton style is very entertaining and thought provoking. Definitely a must to read whatever your worldview. Un saggio monumentale, non tanto per la lunghezza, quanto per l'architettura del pensiero. Ammirevoli le strutture portanti di questo edificio costruito di fede e ragione. Le architravi della ragione puntellano le fondamenta dello spirito, mentre le volte della spiritualità accolgono le voci della ragione. Nel pensiero di Chesterton la dualità umana vive una simbiosi assolutamente plausibile e sensata. Non tutti potranno apprezzare questo saggio, men che meno coloro che solitamente galleggiano in superficie."
Bushido: The Soul of Japan (AmazonClassics Edition),"Inazo Nitobé’s Bushido: The Soul of Japan is a poetic inquiry into the ethos of his homeland.
Through a study of the way of the samurai, Nitobe identifies the seven virtues most widely recognized by the Japanese: rectitude, courage, benevolence, politeness, veracity, honor, and loyalty. In sharing these moral guidelines, handed down over generations, Nitobe gives the world unique insight into a previously unexplored code of honor.
Written in English and only translated years later into Japanese, Bushido was an inspiration to many Western leaders, including two US presidents—Theodore Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. After centuries, the samurai principles are now applied around the world and recognized as universal ideals.
Revised edition: Previously published as Bushido: The Soul of Japan, this edition of Bushido: The Soul of Japan (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Caught up in the whole anime craze, namely shows like Dragonball (Z), YuYu Hakusho, Naruto (Shippuden), and Bleach, I started to wonder what attracted me to these shows (other than the cool fight scenes, comedy, explosions, and the often not so subliminal sexual intimations). No, there was something more that made it so easy to empathize with some of the characters and fall in love with these shows in general, but I could not put a finger on it. I then thought about the demographic (in America) that has the same level of excitement for these shows and manga, but it did not really make the picture clearer. I then thought about the creators of a lot of these programs and the land that they come from and I intuited that there must be something there that is influencing them and their culture that is sculpting the stories that they are writing. At the time I was on a Bleach binge so I thought an investigation into samurai was a good place to start. To say my investigation was not very thorough is hyperbolic, as I looked around, found a free book written by an actual Japanese person giving insight into the life and consequence of the samurai and Japan and decided to base my entire thesis on that. To further demonstrate the narrow scope of my findings, the book was written at the start of the 20th century by a man who grew up with a lifestyle much more similar to that of an European Christian of the same stature at the time. That being said, I myself being a Christian living in a society with strong European roots, I realized his hybrid upbringing of being a Japanese man being taught traditional European beliefs and cultural while in Japan made him the perfect translator of Japan for those from a European culture. So while you can never paint a picture of an entire people or place through the words of one man, I believe that Inazo Nitobe performs quite markedly in this endeavor. He pulls at the heartstrings of his audience with what they do understand, while adjoining that emotion to what would pull on the heartstrings of the Japanese in the same way. A task which is he situated to perform better than most with this specific subject matter. While the story of one cannot tell you the story of one thousand, this is a good story to start with. Nitobe Inazo's Bushido: The Soul of Japan is historically important, representing one of several efforts by intellectuals in modernizing Japan to explain the country to themselves as well as westerners. It should NOT be taken as a factual account of widespread ethics or philosophy before the Meiji Restoration of 1867. On the contrary, Nitobe was looking for an ethical system to make the basis of the new Japan, and specifically wanted something that would be as effective a base as Christianity in Europe and the United States. Bushido was not a unified ethical system until Nitobe made it so. There were samurai codes in the Tokugawa period, but no nationwide system, and in any case it did not apply to non-samurai Japanese. To the extent that there was a society-wide ethical system in Tokugawa Japan, it was that of Confucius and especially the two neo-confucian thinkers Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming.

It's better to read Nitobe's book as a prescription for what came after, rather than as an explanation of what came before. It is particularly interesting that this text, elevating the values of warriors above all else, was written by a Christian--Nitobe was actually a Quaker--yet the nationalism over-rides any desire he might have felt to argue for the evangelization of his country.

Nitobe's construction of the way of the samurai has now thoroughly penetrated popular culture inside and outside Japan, which makes this still a very important book. All one has to do is look at how many Japanese anime popular worldwide revolve around the themes in his book to see that. Nitobe had a moment of genius here in synthesizing a variety of pre-modern Japanese ideas and practices with those of modern nation-state ideologies, and the results were very useful to the expanding Japanese empire. The same could be said of Okakura Kakzuo's Book of Tea: important to subsequent historical events, but unreliable as a guide to earlier times. This book is short, and accessibly written (provided you view ordinary late nineteenth-century writing as accessible).

When reading this book, it is important to remember two things:

1. It was written in 1900. The approach and the ethics therefore reflect the attitudes and society of the nineteenth century, not the twenty-first.
2. It was written by a Japanese man who had seen the fall of the feudal system, to explain Japanese and, particularly, samurai culture to Westerners. In fact, it was originally written in English and only later translated into Japanese.

Some people have criticised this book for its ethics in general - but I think this is unjust, as it's a book of its time. Although there are parts which do more than merely raise eyebrows, it is only fair to the book, and to the author, to acknowledge that our ethics are a century away from Nitobe's. It is unfair to expect a nineteenth-century Japanese man to have exactly the same moral values as twenty-first century Westerners.

Others have criticised the book for its very intent: to explain Japanese culture in terms that Westerners could understand. Again, it's very easy to criticise from our twenty-first century internet-enabled Western point of view. If we want to know about Japan, or any other country, we can look it up on the internet in a few moments. In fact, nowadays, it's very hard not to know at least a little about other cultures unless you deliberately shut yourself off.

It was different at the end of the nineteenth century: Japan had only just emerged from its isolation, and not only was its culture strange to the Western world, but most societies were much less multicultural than they are now, so people were less likely to have encountered a culture other than their own.

Thus, Nitobe discusses Bushido with lots of Western and Christian comparisons and examples, because these are what will make sense to his chosen audience.

The result is a very interesting book.

Nitobe himself was born in 1862, so he was eight years old when feudalism was abolished, and ten when the carrying of swords was forbidden. This not only gives Nitobe a unique perspective, but also means that when the book was written, many Japanese people would have remembered the feudal system. To them, it was not some foreign practice - it was their own culture. It was normal.

So with this book, there is a strange mix of explanation and defence. Nowadays, it's shocking to read the story of an eight-year-old samurai boy being ordered to commit seppuku (ceremonial suicide by disembowelment) and actually doing it. But under bushido - and to Nitobe, who seems to have been of the samurai class himself, or close to it - the story emphasises the strength of devotion to duty, and courage, of even samurai children.

The attitude to women, too, is shocking nowadays. However, it's important to remember that since this was written in 1900, the attitude to women in the West wasn't much different. Admittedly, young girls in the West weren't given daggers in case they needed to commit suicide to protect their honour - but then, neither were boys. If you read much about the life of women in the West during the late 19th century, you do wonder who had the better deal: the samurai girl in feudal Japan, or the middle-class young woman in London.

All in all, this is a very interesting and thought-provoking book - and not the least because it's not written as a scholarly study by an outsider, but by a man trying to explain (and, in some senses, justify) his own culture. It therefore has the result of telling the reader perhaps more about feudal Japanese society and culture than even the author intended. 事前に、日本文を読んでおいたほうが、
把握しやすいと思います。 The author is exceptionally gifted in integrating of worldview, religion and philosophy! Because I know and understand what he is integrating I can better understand Bushido. O melhor livro que já encontrei sobre a doutrina Bushido. Para os interessados no tema com certeza uma leitura indispensável! Bushido, the Soul of Japan is an extraordinary book by Inazo Nitobe. It is extraordinary because it talks about the spirit and personality of Japan. There are many things discussed by the author which can classify as generic tenets of philosophy like Justice, Courage, Benevolence, Honor etc. but to practice these in principle and remain in control are things that Japanese have demonstrated over ages and that is really the soul of Japan. A must read if you are fascinated by the way Japan has developed."
America Is in the Heart: A Personal History (AmazonClassics Edition),"Carlos Bulosan’s idealism and ambition would seem to position him for certain success in America, even given how young he is when he first makes the journey from the Philippines. However, after arriving in Seattle, employers are far more concerned with his Filipino background than they are with his character. Low-paying jobs—and an uncertain future—remain his daily reality. Working the harvest trail from the Pacific Northwest down to California, Bulosan is subject to labor disputes, police brutality, vigilantism, and racial prejudice, but he somehow manages to retain his spirit, his drive, and his belief in a better future. A moving exploration of life on the social and economic margins, America Is in the Heart is a vital testimony of Asian American literature.
Revised edition: Previously published as America Is in the Heart, this edition of America Is in the Heart: A Personal History (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. America is in the Heart by Carlos Bulosan

""They've all come to look for America..."" -- Simon and Garfunkel's lyric from ""America"" was the constant soundtrack in my mind as I read this book. Few books are written by those in extreme poverty, much less by immigrants for whom English is a new language. While Steinbeck captured The Depression in The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan actually experienced it firsthand, and barely survives to tell the tale. As an immigrant, he has the unique vantage of experiencing the intense poverty and racism in America as still preferable to the unending poverty of his family's tenant-farming community in Binolonan, Pangasinan, Philippines. “You shouldn’t have come to America. But you can’t go back now. You can never go back, Allos.”

This work was published in 1946, on the eve of Philippines' independence. Much like reading various histories of America's (only) colonial project in the Philippines, Bulosan's depiction of stowing away in railroad boxcars looking for the next opportunity, the next meal, or escaping the last brutality, I find that this story is of an America forgotten, and hardly known, and deeply relevant in a year (2020) when both civil rights, police reform, and socialist movements are back in the forefront of activism. While many details may be fictionalized, or names and places altered or obscured, it is still autobiographical and quite vivid. Very few people from the depths publish a book their experiences, much less an immigrant in times when the U.S. Congress, and California, specifically passed laws limiting what Asian immigrants could do or own. Americans today are aware of the Japanese being interned in World War II, fewer are aware of laws that excluded Japanese from owning lands, from Asians holding office, or even marrying white U.S. citizens. This is part of what gives the book such great value.

""I came to know afterward that in many ways it was a crime to be a Filipino in California. I came to know that the public streets were not free to my people: we were stopped each time these vigilant patrolmen saw us driving a car. We were suspect each time we were seen with a white woman. And perhaps it was this narrowing of our life into an island, into a filthy segment of American society, that had driven Filipinos like Doro inward, hating everyone and despising all positive urgencies toward freedom.""

Bulosan's story is one of repeated survival, maintaining a love of life, and finding one's purpose. Carlos Bulosan was an Ilocano raised in Binalonan in Pangasinan. The tragedies his family experience there is a great window into village life in the Philippines even today. Wealthy, politically-connected landowners who live in Manila make decisions that ruin the lives of those sharecropping the estates. Bulosan watches as his father sells the only bits of land he owns in order to send one son to school. He details the tragedies of livelihoods lost after one bad flood wipes out the rice crop, or when illiterate farmers get cheated in contracts they don't understand.

""Some of my uncles were already dispossessed of their lands, so they went to the provincial government and fought for justice; but they came back to the village puzzled and defeated. It was then that one of my uncles resorted to violence and died violently, and another entered a world of crime and criminals. But my father believed in the eternal goodness of man...The peasants did not know to whom they should present their grievances or whom to fight when the cancer of exploitation became intolerable. They became cynical about the national government and the few powerful Filipinos of foreign extraction who were squeezing a fat livelihood out of it.""

Bulosan sells wares with his mother in neighboring villages, or breaks his leg climbing trees to cut coconuts, scrapping to put food on the table and continue his brother's education, in the hopes that he will make it out. He lists no dates in the book, so one has to guess at the years based on the events as he observes them as a child. He had a brother who fought in World War I, others who trained with the Philippines Scouts, and is vaguely aware of political movements in the gradual transition from U.S. colony to U.S. commonwealth toward full independence. In these hardships, Filipinos rely on their large families, and the love and sacrifice is evident. After immigrating to the USA, Bulosan repeatedly reconnects with his brothers in various (often criminal) circumstances, initially making personal sacrifices for them, and watching them do the same for him later. It's a beautiful picture of family and love, while also a tragic picture-- they can never go home again.

""I wanted to cry because my brother was no longer the person I had known in Binalonan. He was no longer the gentle, hard-working janitor in the presidencia. I remembered the time when he had gone to Lingayen to cook for my brother Macario! Now he had changed, and I could not understand him any more. “Please, God, don’t change me in America!” I said to myself, looking the other way so that I would not cry.""

The author's journey in America begins with the typical storybook optimism--surely life will be better here. Bulosan quickly experiences Alaskan commercial fishing, canning factories in Washington, and various fruit picking and restaurant kitchen jobs from California to Idaho, while also becoming a successful gambler. He witnesses seasoned migrants exploiting newcomers, different Asian nationalities competing with and exploiting one another, legislated discrimination, and abject police brutality that essentially cripples him for life.

""In San Diego, where I tried to get a job, I was beaten upon several occasions by restaurant and hotel proprietors. I put the blame on certain Filipinos who had behaved badly in America, who had instigated hate.""

“Listen to the brown monkey talk,” said one of the detectives, slapping Alonzo in the face. “He thinks he has the right to be educated. Listen to the bastard talk English. He thinks he is a white man. How do you make this white woman stick with you, googoo? The divorcée was driven out of town, warned never to see Filipinos again.""

""It was then a simple thing for the state legislature to pass a law forbidding marriage between members of the Malayan and Caucasian races. This action was followed by neighboring states until, when the war with Japan broke out in 1941, New Mexico was the nearest place to the Pacific Coast where Filipino soldiers could marry Caucasian women.""

""I knew that our decadence was imposed by a society alien to our character and inclination, alien to our heritage and history. It took me a long time, then, to erase the outward scars of these years, but the deep, invisible scars inside me are not wholly healed and forgotten.""

Despite it all, Bulosan develops friendships with Americans who are also critical of the injustices they see. His strong desire to live propels him forward with the hope that things can and will be better. He is always struck by the two Americas he is always facing-- kindness and opportunity with cruelty and discrimination. Amazingly, Bulosan maintains his faith in the idea of America:

""And yet in this hospital, among white people—Americans like those who had denied us—we had found refuge and tolerance. Why was America so kind and yet so cruel? Was there no way to simplifying things in this continent so that suffering would be minimized? Was there no common denominator on which we could all meet? I was angry and confused, and wondered if I would ever understand this paradox.""

""(T)he American earth was like a huge heart unfolding warmly to receive me. I felt it spreading through my being, warming me with its glowing reality. It came to me that no man—no one at all—could destroy my faith in America again. It was something that had grown out of my defeats and successes, something shaped by my struggles for a place in this vast land, digging my hands into the rich soil here and there, catching a freight to the north and to the south, seeking free meals in dingy gambling houses, reading a book that opened up worlds of heroic thoughts. It was something that grew out of the sacrifices and loneliness of my friends, of my brothers in America and my family in the Philippines—something that grew out of our desire to know America, and to become a part of her great tradition, and to contribute something toward her final fulfillment. I knew that no man could destroy my faith in America that had sprung from all our hopes and aspirations, ever.""

I bought this book after Amazon kept recommending it to me, especially after I bought Gina Apostol's Insurrecto. I've worked in the Philippines and studied its history, particular its American period, pretty closely (see my other reviews) but I had never heard of this book, much less was I aware there was a Penguin Classic by a Filipino author. A poll of my university-educated Filipino friends found only one had read it--and she owns a bookshop that specializes in Filipino literature (she said ""Bulosan is canon."") Apparently this book was ""rediscovered"" in the 1970s and made popular again. I recommend skipping the Introduction, a lengthy dissertation by a modern Bulosan scholar, until after completing the book. I highly recommend this book to Americans working in the Philippines for a perspective they will not otherwise have on rural poverty, the real problem of land ownership and corruption, the unique desperation of Filipinos trying to immigrate to the United States, and the breadth and trials of the Filipino immigrant diaspora.

Unsurprisingly, recently unclassified files show that Bulosan's associations and writings drew the interest of the FBI as a Communist agitator. The book gives insight into the labor organization movements of migrant agricultural workers in the 1930s, and Bulosan indeed befriends many Leftist Communists, intensely interested in the fight in Europe against fascism and at least one of whom returned to Russia.

It is difficult to keep in mind that Bulosan was illiterate for much of his life and was unable to record his thoughts in English until much later. Unable to attend school, he essentially becomes self-taught and it was befriending those in the literary diaspora while dealing with a long hospital stay for tuberculosis that he becomes a voracious reader. This also connected him to other Asian immigrant authors, and Bulosan lists several authors and works that I might check out later. Bulosan starts to have a desire to record the folk tales and other stories from the Philippines, as he realizes much of their literature is lost or unrecorded. His mind also sets to civil rights activism both for working class migrants, but always with a desire to return to help Filipinos in their own homeland.

""(I)f, at the end of my career, I could arrive at a positive understanding of America, then I could go back to the Philippines with a torch of enlightenment. And perhaps, if given a chance, I could help liberate the peasantry from ignorance and poverty...I think this is really the meaning of life: the extension of little things into the future so that they might be useful to other people.”

Five stars. Just finished “America is in the Heart,” a memoir by the Filipino poet Carlos Bulosan, first published in 1946 and reissued this year by the University of Washington Press in a new series called Classics of Asian American Literature. It’s a harrowing read, the story of a peasant boy in the Philippines, dirt poor and on the verge of starvation, who musters all his strength and courage and resourcefulness to find his way to the fields, canneries, and fisheries of the West Coast of the US. There his dreams of freedom crash into the hard realities of discrimination, racism, exploitation, cruelty, and violence. He sees it all—the casual brutality of the cops, the hatred of the vigilantes, the thievery of the bosses, the angry mob chanting, “Why don’t they ship those monkeys back where they came from,” but also the generosity of an emergency room nurse and doctor, the kindness of several chance encounters, and the support of fellow artists. He and his brothers become labor organizers and join the Young Communist League. His experiences—brutal and raw—are an essential part of the complex narrative that is our country. Bulosan persists, certain that the America of his dreams—a place where people take care of one another and cooperate to build a world based on love and respect and justice—is still possible. This story is part of his attempt to make it so.

Woody Guthrie:

The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting
The oranges are piled in their creosote dumps
They're flying you back to the Mexico border
To pay all your money to wade back again.

My father's own father, he waded that river
They took all the money he made in his life
My brothers and sisters come working the fruit trees
And they rode the truck till they broke down and died.

Good-bye to my Juan, good-bye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big air-plane
And all they will call you will be deportees.

Some of us are illegal, and others not wanted
Our work contract's out and we have to move on
But it's six hundred miles to that Mexican border
They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves.

We died in your hills, we died in your deserts
We died in your valleys and died on your plains
We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes
Both sides of the river, we died just the same.

Good-bye to my Juan, good-bye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big air-plane
And all they will call you will be deportees.

A sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos canyon
Like a fireball of lightning, it shook all our hills
Who are all these friends, all scattered like dry leaves?
The radio says they are just deportees.

Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?
Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit?
To fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil
And be called by no name except deportees?

Good-bye to my Juan, good-bye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big air-plane
And all they will call you will be deportees. Carlos Bulosan est un écrivain venu aux USA comme migrant à la recherche de travail dans l'entre-deux guerre. Cette autobiographie retrace son histoire depuis son enfance et son adolescence dans une famille paysanne des Philippines et sa lente maturation politique et sociale dans les champs de Californie ou les conserveries en Alaska. Il raconte une vie âpre, une vie de labeur, une vie toujours à la limite et à la marge. L'Amérique comme une promesse au coeur semble toujours se dérober. Contre ce monde dur et violent il oppose avec ses camarades philippin un idéal de lutte socialiste et syndicale. C'est dans ce creuset qu'il se construit et se consume en proie à la maladie.
Récit violent, récit des bas-fonds et des marges, c'est un cri mêlé de douleurs, d'amour et d'espérance. L'Amérique vue d'en bas."
Don Quixote (AmazonClassics Edition),"Don Quixote, a man driven by chivalrous ideals and wild delusions, adopts sword and lance as a knight-errant to defend the weak, slay the ignoble, and win the heart of the farm girl he envisions as a princess. In his world of fantasy—where inns are castles, peasants are kings, and windmills are beasts—Quixote, his nag, and his sound but devoted squire, Sancho Panza, set forth on a picaresque adventure conceivable only to a man obsessed.
One part legendary quest, one part metareflection of that very legend, Don Quixote remains, after four centuries, one of the most radical, profound, playful, and heartbreaking epics ever dreamed.
Revised edition: Previously published as Don Quixote, this edition of Don Quixote (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. There's only one original ""Quixote"", but there are literally dozens of translations, and an almost infinite number of commentaries about the quality, integrity and appeal of those various translations. But, if you would just like to sit down with a readable and fairly mainstream version there are two free Kindle volumes that offer you a happy choice.

The four ""major"" translations that are referenced over and over again are by Smollett, Grossman, Putnam, and Raffel. (There are roughly a dozen ""minor"" but well known and vigorously defended or reviled others.) But, the first translation, which was published in 1612, within just seven years of the release of ""Quixote"" itself, was by Thomas Shelton. The most popular translation after that, until the ""modern"" era, was Ormsby's 1885 version.

Happily, Kindle offers a free copy of Ormsby's version. It also offers a kindleunlimited, (and sometimes free as a promotion), copy of Gerald Davis' reworking of the Shelton version.

Some people favor Raffel, (although faulted for being too oversimplified), or Putnam, (faulted for being too colloquial). Grossman is the most modern, but is frequently criticized for taking great liberties and being almost purposefully prolix and obscure. Of course, each translator brought his or her own sense of style, and own sense of the work, to the project, and all of them felt fairly free to put their own authorial stamp on the book. Ormsby is highly regarded because of his scholarly effort to achieve ""accuracy"". The Davis book is highly regarded, although sometimes relegated to a niche position, because of the translator's attempt to find a middle ground between the Shelton original and a modern reader's sensibilities.

This Kindle Ormsby is the 1885 version, not the Norton update of 1981. But that's fine, since the update modernized some language but didn't change the text dramatically. As a bare public domain version you don't get notes, footnotes, modern annotations and the like. You do, however, get the full text, include Ormsby's analysis of prior translations. The book is formatted well enough and has a basic table of contents. It is readable, if unadorned.

The Kindleunlimited Davis is also barebones, although there is a nice preface by Davis. Again, the formatting and type editing is fine and unfussy. It is also perfectly readable.

I prefer the Davis version, but that really is a matter of personal taste. It is nice to be able to suggest that not only are these two freebies adequate, they do indeed have an honorable place amongst all of the best translations. As a consequence you do not have to lower your standards, or accept an inferior translation, when selecting one of these freebies as your text of choice.

Surprisingly, each Kindle version can be augmented, for a few dollars, with Audible Narration. The Ormsby narration is a bit more energetic, the Davis narration is more solemn. I only sampled them, but both seemed fairly engaging.

Please note, because there are so many editions of each and all of these books, and because Amazon is not at its best when mixing and matching books, editions, and reviews, it's important to mention which books this review refers to. The kindleunlimited Davis displays a white cover and a pencil or engraved image of Don Quixote framed in yellow. It clearly states that it is ""The New Translation By Gerald J. Davis"". The free Ormsby sports the generic Amazon public domain cover, in brown and buff. Don't mistakenly buy some expensive ""collectible"" mass market copy, unless that's what you want. If Monty Python and the Holy Grail was written with ""thee"" and ""thou"" and minus the coconuts. This is an old timey story of an aging gentleman in Spain who, because of his love of trashy novels develops a monomania in regards to becoming knight. He leaves his comfortable house with his good friend Sancho to travel the countryside on his miserable horse to do good deeds and free the lady who he has pledged his heart to. They have all kinds of adventures, real or imaginary, and make many friends and a few enemies along the way. The end shows that deep down Don Quixote really is a good man despite his apparent madness and it is right that he is beloved by all who were his friends.

As to the writing itself, it was written literal ages ago and in Spanish. This version doesn't appear to be particularly modernized so it can be kind of a slog to read. I think part of the joke of the storytelling is just how verbose everyone is which can be a bit tedious but I think it would miss it's mark without the ridiculously flowery language the author is jeering at in other romance novels of the time. It's not an impossible read but a bit like Shakespeare where if you get lost in the language itself you'll miss some of the comedy of the scene. There's poetry, songs, and a ton of maxims from the time to give the story flavor. There didn't appear to be mistakes in the writing itself tho I can't vouch for the quality of the translation. I have been intimidated by this book for a long time because of its sheer volume (quadruple page numbers), and because it was published in the early 1600s, originally in Spanish and later translated into 25 different versions in English. An interesting fact (which I did not know before I starting reading it) is that Don Quixote is the second most translated book after the Bible. I happened to have in my hand the John Ormsby translation edition (published in 1885) which is what the more modern translations are based off of. But I digress.

I am pleasantly surprised because, despite all of my misgivings, I found this story very entertaining to read. I laughed out loud so many times. To me, the comedy is akin to 80s slapstick films (who isn't nostalgic for 80s cinema?!) like The Princess Pride (one of my favorites) and parody spoofs like Spaceballs (also love).

In the story, we meet Don Quixote, our self-deluded, high-falutin knight errant along with his unsophisticated yet down-to-earth squire, Sancho Panza. Their candid friendship is a humorous yet heartwarming interchange of yin and yang. Adventure after adventure (or rather debacle after debacle), Don Quixote and Sancho Panza become more and more endearing as they continue on their so-called quest to live out their chivalric values.

Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are principled and virtuous in their heart of hearts. That is why I adore them and can overlook all their foibles. There are a good number of characters that come along with the many episodes that somehow weave their way back into the main storyline. My favorite minor characters are Teresa Panza (Sancho's wife) and Marcela from Chapter XIV (a resounding amen to that speech of hers... ¡Viva Marcela!)

Down the road, I think it is definitely worthwhile to re-read this book in a more modern translation version by either John D. Rutherford or Edith Grossman, which I hear are both excellent editions. Don Quixote (auf englisch) sehr schön;
das sollten alle mal probieren: ein englisches Buch lesen! mit dem Kindle kann man mit einem als Standard installiertem Wörterbuch eine schnelle Übersetzung einzelner Wörter erreichen;

ein Klassiker in gehobener Sprache; es handelt sich um eine Satire, da es damals schon keine Ritter mehr gab; Narration of the story is amazing,how the writer collected that many proverbs is unimaginable.He placed every word in such a way that reader must find amusement by reading it. Love this book... The book 5/5. This translation (Pandora's Box Classics) 4/5 - this is NOT the Edith Grossman translation that the Amazon blurb would have you believe. It is however remarkable value and a fantastic series of remarkable adventures. If you find it a bit 'slow' for a couple of chapters, stick with it - it picks up pace and the second of the two Parts that make up this book just flies by. Even though it is longer in terms of chapters than the first part, the second part is easier as a casual read (ie alongside other books). So start off by making this a serious read and investing some time, and then once the characters are established you won't be able to stop picking it up even for a quick chapter to see what new nonsense they are up to. Great, amusing, estupendo. This book is the best I have ever read in my whole life. It's worth to read."
A Christmas Carol (AmazonClassics Edition),"Ebenezer Scrooge has no time for the poor or the wretched. And it’s “Bah, humbug!” to anyone who wishes him a Merry Christmas. But when he turns in for the night one cold, fateful Christmas Eve, his past, present, and future converge. Three haunting guests are about to show him that the time has come to change his miserly ways—before it’s too late.
Discover the everlasting spirit of the holiday season in Charles Dickens’s cherished story of hope, joy, empathy, and love.
Revised edition: Previously published as A Christmas Carol, this edition of A Christmas Carol (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. “I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone,” (Dickens 144) the once miserly, old Scrooge pledges desperately to the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come as they stand over Scrooge’s future grave, following their witnessing of the nightmarish images of his own forthcoming death and its pitiable consequences. Charles Dickens’ charming and clever classic tale of Ebenezer Scrooge and his change of heart has touched a countless number of people over generations. This five-star novel’s utterly moving message and immense genius will touch many more to come, and urge others to make the pledge to “honor Christmas in [their own hearts], and try to keep it all the year,” (Dickens 144), as Scrooge so thoroughly did himself that one Christmas night.
Originally published in the year of 1843, A Christmas Carol summons us to Victorian London, contemporary to the year the story was published. The selfish, stingy, miserly, and miserable, old Ebenezer Scrooge broods in his hatred for the Christmas Season, as Scrooge greatly detests happiness, generosity, love, and family. Christmas Eve night, he is haunted by the ghost of his old business partner, Jacob Marley, who appears to Scrooge with a long, heavy chain made from all of the terrible things that Marley pursued in life. Marley warns Scrooge that he is doomed to Marley’s same, terrible fate unless he changes the way he lives his life. So he tells Scrooge that three more Spirits will haunt him during the course of the night. We all know the story: the Ghosts of Christmases Past, Present, and Yet To Come visit Scrooge and show him moments in his lifetime in order to instill in Scrooge the idea to stop being so dreadful and instead to become compassionate. Throughout Scrooge’s tale, Charles Dickens introduces to us three different methods (one for each of the three spirits) as the tools for a person, such as Scrooge, to change one’s life. A very prominent theme portrayed in A Christmas Carol, is how the application of these three methods will change someone’s heart.
The Ghost of Christmas Past is the first of the three to appear to Scrooge and the first to apply one of Dickens’ methods to change Scrooge’s heart. The Ghost of Christmas Past takes Scrooge back to his childhood and early years to show him all of the people he has loved. He sees his beloved, younger sister, Fan, the mother of his ever-encouraging nephew, Fred; he sees the jolly man to whom he was once apprenticed, Fezziwig, and the jovial love he showed to all his family and friends; and Scrooge also sees his former fiancée, reliving not only the scene of when she left him due to his growing greed, but also the images of the happy life she led after she left him. Seeing these people in his past renews Scrooge’s spark of love for his family and friends. Dickens’ first step to a change of heart— love.
The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present succeeds the Ghost of Christmas Past and leads Scrooge through the existing world to see all those who were currently celebrating Christmas. He shows Scrooge the Cratchits, the family of Scrooge’s clerk Bob Cratchit, demonstrating to Scrooge how his habit of penny-pinching and ill behavior toward Bob Cratchit is affecting the poor, struggling family, in particular Bob Cratchit’s crippled son, Tiny Tim. This helps Scrooge feel regret for the decisions he has made and become more generous to those in need. The second method to the changing of Scrooge’s heart was the feeling of regret.
Then the wraithlike Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come appears to Scrooge and shows him scenes from the future. At first, these scenes meant nothing to Scrooge as he saw the people of London’s disgraceful response to a terrible man’s death until Scrooge realized that this terrible man was Scrooge himself. This sudden realization at the setting of Scrooge’s own future grave was the sign of his complete conversion to kindheartedness. He felt absolute fear of the images he saw, and wanted nothing more than to reverse them. Hence, The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come applied the final method of transformation— fear for the future’s terrible consequences.
So there are the keys to Scrooge’s conversion— love, regret, and fear for the future. The theme of how the application of these three methods is the key to changing someone’s frame of mind I believe is both valid and properly conveyed. With the help of the three spirits that fateful, Christmas Eve night, Ebenezer Scrooge realized that he must always have, “the Spirits of all Three… strive within [him, and] not shut out the lessons that they teach,” because if he went back to not loving, not feeling regret and guilt, and not being wary or fearful of future consequences, Scrooge would return to the greedy, wicked state in which he had found himself the night before. But that theme isn’t the most prominent in Dickens’ A Christmas Carol. The most prominent theme is the happiness one feels when one shows more benevolence, and I think that Dickens displayed this intent more than thoroughly by the end of his tale. And how true that is. Scrooge would’ve gone on living his rotten life with no lasting legacy when he died if it were not for the spirits’ visits. Instead, he spent the rest of his years becoming “as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world,” (Dickens 158).
In Charles Dickens’ flawlessly written tale of A Christmas Carol, Scrooge learns that happiness can come to us if we will forget self and worldly gain, concentrating instead on helping others and learning to embrace the love of family and friends. Dickens’ clear, concise, and beautiful depiction of the world’s most beloved Christmas story second only to Christmas’ inspiration is one that everyone would benefit from reading. And may those who read it, remember themselves to “honor Christmas in [their hearts], and try to keep it all the year,” (Dickens 144). KindleUnlimited review. In recent years I have reread this short book each Christmas season and acquire a renewed appreciation each time. With only five chapters, it’s a short book and takes less than three hours to read in one sitting (as does the audiobook version). Nearly everyone knows the story or some variation of its retelling. Therefore, I’ll not attempt a synopsis but rather highlight my favorite passages and those different from the more familiar film adaptations. For instance, the arrival of the three spirits visiting Scrooge is always differently presented in film adaptations: “Expect the first to-morrow, when the bell tolls One… Expect the second on the next night at the same hour. The third upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate.” Most versions depict all three ghosts in one night. Scrooge specifically requested this but was rebuffed by Marley: “Couldn’t I take ’em all at once, and have it over, Jacob?” hinted Scrooge.”

Dickens’ ability to poetically describe a scene is best presented by the mines absent from film adaptations: “… they stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed, or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass. Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night.” Likewise, the Ghost of Christmas Present’s two companions - the boy as Ignorance and the girl as Want - is a more harsh rebuke of Scrooge than many adaptations.

Most versions retain the book end narrations but omit the internal ones. That’s a shame but the best reason to read the original text. The narrator’s interpretations of place and people would be an improvement in any film adaptations. However, most renditions do end with this poignant verse: “Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew... May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!” This story will pluck at one’s emotional heart strings each time. I purchased these for my Literature students before Christmas, and this edition is an unabridged text for a very good price. We had a joy-filled week reading the book together during the week before Christmas break. Highly recommend! I love this story so much! And what a beautiful edition! As soon as I laid eyes on the A Christmas Carol: Deluxe Gift Edition, I knew it would be a marvelous addition to my bookshelf. Charles Dickens' timeless tale of redemption has always held a special place in my heart, and this beautifully crafted edition has exceeded all my expectations.

From the moment I cracked open the cover, I was transported to the magical world of Ebenezer Scrooge and his extraordinary journey towards self-discovery. The vivid descriptions and rich language used by Dickens evoke a sense of nostalgia, perfectly capturing the atmosphere of Victorian London and the enchantment of the holiday season.

What truly sets this edition apart from others is its stunning presentation. The book's hardcover is beautifully embossed, giving it a classic and elegant feel. The high-quality paper enhances the reading experience, giving weight to every turn of the page. The font is easy on the eyes, making it a joy to delve into the story.

Without fail, each time I delve into this edition, I can't help but feel a childlike excitement bubbling within me. The story of Scrooge's transformation from a cold-hearted miser to a joyous and compassionate individual never fails to ignite the anticipation for the upcoming Christmas season. Every word resonates with the spirit of the holiday, reminding us of the importance of love, generosity, and the power of redemption.

The introduction provides valuable insights into Dickens' motivations and influences, enhancing my appreciation for the story's depth and social critique. Additionally, the inclusion of various notes and historical context helps contextualize the narrative, adding another layer of richness to the reading experience.

In conclusion, the A Christmas Carol: Deluxe Gift Edition is an exquisite addition to any bookshelf, an invitation to relive the timeless tale of generosity, redemption, and the power of change. The combination of a beautiful physical presentation, captivating illustrations, and Dickens' captivating storytelling makes this edition an absolute must-have for anyone seeking to be whisked away to the enchanting world of Ebenezer Scrooge and the true spirit of Christmas. 交換をしてほしいので保管しています。 I'm an adult but I always like such books which are written targets audience as child Good quality 👍🏿"
The Island of Doctor Moreau (AmazonClassics Edition),"On an uncharted South Pacific island, the mad genius Doctor Moreau has found refuge. It’s here, away from London and the civilized world, that the scientist can conduct his experiments on animals without condemnation. When Edward Prendick, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, washes ashore, he bears witness to Moreau’s cruel research and its bloody, inevitable unraveling.
In exploring the disquieting crossroads of scientific progress and ethical responsibility, Wells’s cautionary account of the perversion of natural order rattles readers’ sensibilities to this day.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Island of Doctor Moreau, this edition of The Island of Doctor Moreau (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Well, my, my, my what do we have here? This great horror classic was recommended to me by Kindle Unlimited. I was astounded to learn they have a whole classic horror book section, many of which I’ve been dying to read, but didn’t want to pay the absorbent price. This is an avid reader’s dream come true. Yay, Me!

As I was reading the synopsis of The Island of Dr. Moreau, I immediately thought of another favorite franchise of mine, Jurassic Park. And what was more unbelievable is this novel was written well over a hundred and twenty years ago, and yet, the author was so ahead of his time and, dare I say it, pretty spot on. This caused me to shudder.

Shipwrecked Edward Prendick happened upon a boat that saved his life. But almost immediately, he noticed something strange about the men who was assisting him from the wreckage. These men sort of looked human and sort of looked animal like at the same time. Well, how can that be?

One gentleman, if you can call him that, looked ape-like and spoke some English but not as well as Prendick felt he should. Once he got to the island, he soon realized that a very infamous doctor he’d read about just so happened to be on the same island that has now become Prendick’s savior, or was it? After proper introductions, Prendick immediately heard the cries of what sounded like an animal in distress or was that a man in distress? He didn’t know which, but no matter, the sound terrified him and he wanted to know more.

As he began exploring the island, Dr. Moreau’s assistant, Montgomery, warned him that he might not want to go exploring by himself for he may stumble across some things that he may not understand, which for Prendick was a huge understatement having seen animals that were human. But his eyes must be deceiving him, right?

Once Prendick discovered the secrets of Dr. Moreau’s Island, it became abundantly clear that Dr. Moreau took some creative licenses with his scientific studies a bit too far and Prendick realized that his life was in great danger.

OMG! I haven’t had a horror book that scared me that terribly since The Exorcist. My heart was pounding so hard and I stopped breathing as Prendick was running for his life. I felt like I was in a race. This classic was everything and more! I loved all the fear I experienced in reading it. Wow! It’s so terrifying knowing what science can actually do and when it falls into the wrong hands, you can have an island like the one Dr. Moreau created. Like many my age, I was introduced to H.G. Wells via cinema. Of all his stories, I found this one to be intriguing and interesting, mainly because it asked the question of what happens when you try to play God.

With a mixture of the mythological chimera and Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_, this story dives into a theory of what would happen if a person tried to ""civilize"" wild animals.

In all, great book; can't wait to read more of Wells' work I am so impressed at how a book almost entirely in narrative captivated me. Wells seemed to find the perfect way to describe the hellish existence of Pendrick, each word beautifully expressed. The suspense is built page by page, and I kept turning each page late into the few nights it took me to complete reading it. Incredible. Filiquarian Publishing, LLC published this book under the idea that it is in ""public domain status."" Meaning, it is not any better than you would find online. The book is readable, but emphasis (bold or italics) are done by an underscore before and after the word(s). Example: ""_His_ is the lightning flash, we sang. _His_ is the deep, salt sea."" (page 82) To me, it is annoying to read it this way. You occasionally find extra quotation marks and a double dash (--) in the place of an ellipsis (...). On page 41, you get all of the above.

The binding is right up there with self-published titles. The cover is as basic as it gets, and has no text on the spine (see picture.) The back cover has merely a UPC barcode. On my copy, the glue they used for the spine was pressed out and made a rather strange bind. By strange, I mean cheap-looking.

Anyway, if you are looking for an inexpensive copy of this book and don't care about the bindery or text issues, then this book is for you. 大洋の真直中で漂流していた語り手プレンディックは、謎の男モンゴメリーの船に救助される。二人が向かった先は海図にも載っていない、学界と縁を切った孤高の天才、モロー博士が支配する島だった。そこでは獣からヒトに改造された「獣人」達が、厳しい掟によって人間性を叩き込まれていた。だが彼等の内に潜む獣性はことある毎にそれに反発し、やがては恐るべき破局の時が訪れる。

マッド・サイエンティストものの古典的名作で、進化論を学んだウェルズにしてはとんでもなく戯画化された内容ではあるのだが、本書は恐らくボルヘスの指摘する通り、寓話として読むのが正しいのだろう。人間文明の成立と存続と云う、後年もっとあからさまに論じられるテーマが、早くも語られている点が興味深い。

この新しいペンギン版は、従来の決定版とされるアトランティック版に導入部を補ったもので、本書の読み方を綺麗に纏めた15頁分の解説や、7頁分の註の他、著者略歴、文献案内、テキスト註解が付いていてお薦めである。 The entire novel is a masterpiece but there's a chapter in which Dr. Moreau explains himself and that steals the show. Hands down the best chapter I've ever read. Wells blends philosophy and science-fiction with dexterity. Aumentando mi colección, es un libro delgado, con letras un poco pequeñas, pero muy practico para llevarlo en un viaje, y practicar mi inglés. Un classico della letteratura; non ho letto altre opere dell'autore, ma sia per lo stile che per le emozioni suscitate lo paragonerei a H.P. Lovecraft. Molto bello anche da un punto di vista psicologico, nello specifico nell'ambito della perversione (sono arrivato a questa lettura tramite il libro della Chasseguet-Smirgel ""Creatività e perversione"") Um clássico da literatura da fantasia e ficção cientifica mundial! Não deve perder a oportunidade de ler e comprar. É imprescindível na sua biblioteca."
The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (AmazonClassics Edition),"Dr. Henry Jekyll, fascinated by the dichotomy of good and evil, no longer wants to inhibit his dark side. He concocts a potion to create the alter ego of Mr. Edward Hyde. With the burden of evil placed on Hyde, Jekyll can now take pleasure in his immoral, nefarious fantasies—free of conscience and guilt. It’s when Hyde turns to murder that Jekyll realizes how monstrous his impulses are and how hard they are to suppress.
Exploring the nature of shame, repression, desire, and control, Stevenson’s story has so endured that “a Jekyll and Hyde personality” has become part of our lexicon in understanding our own—sometimes involuntary—duality.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, this edition of The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Reading Robert Louis Stevenson's classic The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I was reminded of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Both novels involve the idea of tampering with science in a controversial way and expecting positive results. Much like Victor Frankenstein learns that you can't ""play God,"" Dr. Jekyll comes to realize the dark side of experimentation gone wrong. Neither character has the resolve to own up and take responsibility of their actions until things are well out of hand.

As much as the novel illustrates how the results of science can turn awry, the story also questions duality within oneself. In the novel, the rational side (Jekyll) of a man is tempted into various forms of sin and sinister behavior (Hyde). One side soon becomes the more dominant of the two, and there is a struggle to escape from this dark side. When Jekyll becomes Hyde, he erupts into various forms of grotesqueness. Hyde is physically repulsive, but also repulsive in character. Hyde in many ways is an outlet for Jekyll to experience unrelenting freedom and ""do as he pleases"", despite the costs or consequences. It's ironic that this newfound ""freedom"" for Jekyll's other self actually turns into a form of a prison, where he has to physically isolate and hide himself from society to protect others.

There are many morals this novel delves into and investigates. There are also many thinking points about human psychology and human nature. In many ways, this novel is groundbreaking and innovative, ahead of its time. It's easy to see why this novel has spawned countless film adaptations and productions, remaining quite popular and part of our pop culture.

Not only that, but this novel is just a great book, well written and with so many different elements. It has exceptional moments of suspense, mystery, philosophy, science, and a darkly Gothic atmosphere to lure you in.

Stevenson's novel is one to read, and then come back to and read again. Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson wrote this story and it was first published in 1896. It is told in the third person by an attorney, Gabriel Utterson, who was both a friend of and lawyer of a well-respected physician, Dr. Henry Jekyll. Mr. Utterson becomes concerned about his friend when given Dr. Jekyll's will that leaves everything to a strange man named Edward Hyde. Mr. Utterson becomes curious about Mr. Hyde and investigates him. When he finds horrifies him. While Henry Jekyll is kindly, jovial, and dedicated to helping others in this community, Mr. Hyde seems utterly without any redeeming characteristics and is prone to despicable acts. When Mr. Utterson asks his friend why he would leave his estate to such a person, Dr. Jekyll will not answer.

What is the relationship between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? What are the horrible things that attorney Utterson will find as he gradually uncovers the truth? Why is Dr. Jekyll protective of Mr. Hyde and dedicated to making sure he ends up cared for? What secrets does Dr. Jekyll have? Is Dr. Jekyll really good person everyone thinks them to be?

The story of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is intriguing and complex. The characters are well-drawn and evolve over the course of the story. The pace of the story can be described as moderate, with a few rapid developments spaced across long periods of buildup. The word-choice is sophisticated, as is the vocabulary. What I did not like is the fact that Robert Louis Stevenson was very prone to use complex, compound sentences with a plethora of semicolons. Some of the sentences seem to run on, the paragraphs were often quite long, and it was not unusual to go more than two pages without a paragraph break. When that occurred the author came off as long-winded.

I had never read this book before but I had read other pieces by Robert Louis Stevenson. I was able to get this one free as an e-book and, while I did enjoy the story, I am not sure that I would want to pay for it. If you have not read it and are curious, I suggest you visit your local library.

Thank you for reading my review, which I previously posted on a now-closed site. The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a story that almost everyone on the planet has heard about whether they've read this story, heard about it in passing, or a reference in pop culture. It's a story that people have been talking about for over a century.

This book has always been one of those books I felt like I needed to read, just to get a glimpse of what made this story so popular for this long, and even though I already knew the gist of it, what I read lived up to expectation.

The story is told through about three different perspectives if my memory serves correct. The Lawyer (Mr. Utterson), Lanyon, and Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde). And it starts off with a tale of the evils of a guy named Mr. Hyde. Utterson has heard of that name before and so he goes home to remember where he heard it from. Mr. Hyde is then linked to Dr. Jekyll because of Jekyll leaving everything to this evil ogre of a man in his will. Utterson grows suspicious and continuously asks about this Hyde character. He even goes to Jekyll, but Dr. Jekyll doesn't reveal the true nature of Mr. Hyde and their relationship to one another.

This book keeps you guessing (even though you most likely already know the deal with Jekyll and Hyde), but in the final chapter, everything is revealed from the perspective of Dr. Jekyll himself... also Mr. Hyde.

It was a quick and interesting read that kept me engaged even though it is admittedly very wordy -for lack of a better word. It's also very shocking to know that this story was written in the late 1800s. This story aged very well. It really is a timeless classic. Buen libro de buena calidad. did not mention it is an abridged version. Era un regalo. Le ha gustado mucho, bien encuadernado.
Igual que en la foto ""Dr Jekyll et Mr Hyde"" est un classique incontournable qui explore la dualité de l'âme humaine. À travers une écriture captivante, Robert Louis Stevenson nous plonge dans une intrigue sombre où le bien et le mal s'affrontent au sein d'un même individu. J'ai été fasciné par l'évolution du personnage et la manière dont l'auteur illustre la lutte intérieure entre la morale et les pulsions. Ce livre, bien que court, offre une réflexion profonde sur la nature humaine et reste pertinent, même aujourd'hui. À lire absolument pour les amateurs de littérature classique et de récits psychologiques ! O livro é incrível, mas não é o que você espera.
Você pode esperar algo como incrível Hulk, mas aqui você vai receber algo mais cabeça e racista, o monstro na verdade é um homem baixinho...Não um gigante."
The Three Musketeers (AmazonClassics Edition),"Young nobleman d’Artagnan has arrived in Paris intent on joining the guardians of King Louis XIII. He befriends the regiment’s most formidable musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and together they unite in their commitment to uphold justice. Soon, a royal indiscretion thrusts them into an audacious escapade of courtly intrigue, thwarted romance, and daring rescue. But it’s the Machiavellian schemes of a powerful enemy and the wicked seductions of an ingenious female spy that will be their greatest challenges.
Alexandre Dumas’s thrilling epic stands as one of the most entertaining historical adventures ever written and has made immortal the all-for-one heroism of these comrades in arms.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Three Musketeers, this edition of The Three Musketeers (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. The last Dumas I read was The Count of Monte Cristo, back in 2003 or so. I remember it having some long patches, some filler-material, but I also remember being enthralled by the sheer storytelling power, and finishing it in record time.
The Three Musketeers, I think, is better still. There's very little padding, and the only bit that rankled a little was a section in which the exposition was handled very stagily, in the sense of old-fashioned exposition: two nonentities come onto the stage and explain all the backstory in dialogue that is as flat as a pancake. In the section in question, however, the two characters were important ones, and it seemed odd how they suddenly began to behave. It was around this section too that D'Artagnan started behaving rather strangely, more like a puppet than a man. Not only was he using one woman to get at another, (Kitty, Milady's maid, to get at Milady) and showing uncharacteristic integrity, but his apparent bedazzlement by Milady was somehow unbelievable.
Apart from that, the story zips along at such a pace that you find yourself reading page after page, trying to keep up with the speed of things. The humour is wonderful, there's very little purple prose for a 19th century novel, and the characters, though occasionally inconsistent, are in general well-drawn. The villains are villains to the core; no mistaking them. The heroes will die for anything and everything that seems true. The women are wonderful, and the men passionate and energetic. And the suspense is terrific (even if you've seen one or two movie versions of the story).
Certainly the morals of the the characters leave something to be desired. Dumas even comments on their behaviour a couple of times by telling us that this was how people behaved then - as if to excuse the fact that he was making them behave this way. And the way he weaves history into his story - bending it when necessary - is excellent. One of the hard parts of reading literature from another language is that you must trust the translator has faithfully translated the text in such a way that what you read in your language is as close to the original as possible. Previous to this translation I had only read the Penguin Classics version translated by Lord Sudley in 1952. I had enjoyed the story but always felt the translation substandard. I showed my wife what a difference there is between Lord Sudley's translation and that of Richard Pevear. Consider from page 700 of the Sudley translation the following:

'Lord de Winter, will you bring your charges next,' said Athos.
De Winter stepped forward in his turn.
'Before God and men,' he said, 'I charge this woman with having caused the murder of the Duke of Buckingham!'
'The Duke of Buckingham murdered!' cried the four musketeers.
'Yes, murdered,' replied de Winter. 'When I got your warning letter I had this woman arrested and put her in the charge of a man I thought I could trust. But she seduced him; she persuaded him to do this thing; she even put the knife into his hand. And now Felton's to die to atone for this fiend's crime.'

And from page 654 of Pevear's translation:

'It is your turn, Milord!' said Athos.
The baron stepped forward.
'Before God and men,' he said, 'I accuse this woman of having the duke of Buckingham assassinated.'
'The duke of Buckingham assassinated?' those present all cried out as one.
'Yes,' said the baron, 'assassinated! On receiving your letter of warning, I had this woman arrested, and I placed her in the custody of a loyal servant. She corrupted the man, she put the dagger in his hand, she had him kill the duke, and at this very moment, perhaps, Felton is paying for this fury's crime with his head.'

The overall feel of reading Peavar's translation is a close bond with the book, the characters, and the story. It is lively and explosive. I recommend this translation over any other for new readers of this book. Considering how many books I read per month, I am staggered that it took me 32 years to finally get around to reading the Three Musketeers. This is an excellent book and one of the best pieces of literature that I have ever got my hands on. I was totally gripped from start to finish.

D'Artagnan goes to Paris to seek his fortune and hopefully to join the coveted King's Musketeers. No sooner is he in the capital than he is fighting a duel with the Musketeers and this brings him to their notice. Since there are no vacancies in the elite group, D'Artagnan is put in the Kings Guards and promised a place in the Musketeers when a vacancy arises. Despite this though, D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers, Porthos, Aramis and Athos, are soon inseparable and are soon getting into fights and adventures, especially with the dangerous Cardinal Richeleau and the deadly but mysterious Milady. But with people like the Duke of Buckingham, Lord De Winter and Monsieur De Trevielle, the group soon triumph and get the girl...

A wonderfully written, absorbing story and I can't wait for part 2 in the Musketeers trilogy. Edizione economica con copertina flessibile Vintage Classics French Series. È molto leggero e i caratteri non sono troppo piccoli. In fondo al libro ci sono molte note che aiutano a comprendere aspetti storici. Rapporto qualità prezzo ottimale. One of Alexandre Dumas' classic novels so beautifully bound. Font is a bit small but readable. Recommend. Todo bien me encanto el diseño de la pasta blanda además de que llego rápido y sin daños. Estoy feliz con el servicio y el producto. I fell in love with this book the first time I read it, forty years ago. It’s almost like I fall in love with it for the first time, every time I have reread it since. I only remember reading the sequels once, many years ago, and seem to recall them being somewhat too tragic for me to handle at that early age. I have not reread any of the sequels since.

The Three Musketeers continues to be one of my favourite classics, but do I have a favourite Musketeer? So difficult to say, each one of them is unique in his own way, yet rather similar in certain characteristics. Each one of them has personality traits that you can relate to. What is great about this book is that the supporting cast is just as good, Milady of course my first introduction to the concept of a femme fatale.

A swashbuckling tale of heroism, glory, political intrigue, romance, it deserves its place in the pantheon of greatest classics of all time. Highest possible recommendation, and as a bonus, I also recommend Sebastien de Castell’s Greatcoats series, which pays homage to this classic."
Around the World in Eighty Days (AmazonClassics Edition),"Pragmatic gambler Phileas Fogg has made a gentlemanly wager to the members of his exclusive club: that he can circle the world in just eighty days, right down to the minute. Fetching his newly appointed French valet, Fogg embarks on a fabulous journey across land and sea—by steamer, rail, and elephant—to win the bet of a lifetime.
Inspired by Jules Verne’s own sea travels and his fascination with circumnavigating the globe, the avid dreamer’s picaresque voyage inspired generations of adventurers who were eager to best Verne’s challenge—from nineteenth-century journalist Nellie Bly to Monty Python’s Michael Palin.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Around the World in Eighty Days, this edition of Around the World in Eighty Days (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Seneca, according to Borges, wrote that man has only time to read 120 books at most, although in those times a book comprised many volumes so it has to mean much more than our skinny books. I just finished the final volume of AmazonClassics edition in my reading list, and with this I have read 60 books of the collection, a skinny achievement but a nice one. 'Around the World in Eighty Days' is a calm example of the talent of Verne, it is notorious he is a professional writer as some structure is noticeable in his books, the research for scientific data, the plot twists paced regularly, a comic (but not ridiculous) relief, the exoticism of locations; among the living authors one writer that makes me feel that same professionalism is Dan Brown. Nevertheless to label Verne as just professional would be an injustice, is professional his meticulous work to point numbers, data and facts for the reader, I enjoyed much to search by images the places described; but along it there is emotion in these stories that will feed your heart if it still has a youthful passion for adventure, stories that are quite amazing and cover vast distances of time and space, is not wonder they are adapted into movies, sadly most of the time not that good movies xP Some circumstances in London spark a commentary by Phileas Fogg, squire, about how modernity has made the world smaller than before, he is a strange man, a good man but living in abstractions, so he is almost casually drawn to prove his words and engage in a journey around the world in eighty days. I devoured this trip, nothing is what it seems, he is a methodical man drawn into the unmethodical world. Is extraordinary that there is a villain but he is not a bad person but bound to duty, there is a friend but bound by loyalty, there is love but it is gradual and natural, there is disasters but he is calm, Phileas Fogg above all is not pushed by greed, and his adventures are not random, the chain of events that determine his journey are important in the events that follow, the reader is not cheated by deus ex machina but it truly feels like you are struggling along the characters in a game with coherent rules. He starts in the more exotic side of the world, and then he reaches the United States, I was afraid that the adventures would wane there into almost a bureaucratic register of trains and ships, but it was quite exotic too, as exciting as a road movie and more rich in imagination than I'd far prefer to visit Verne's U.S. than Peter Pan's Neverland. This is one of the most famous works of Verne so maybe you have seen adaptations that somehow spoil the ending, but nothing compares to read it.

As a final reflection about the AmazonClassics books I can say they are, for works of public domain written in English, the best ones available: professional and exemplar formatting, modern typography, free of errors and free of introductions, studies and footnotes by nosy contemporary intellectuals with modern prejudices, instead, when you need it, there is the X-Ray function (the first paragraphs from the not that trusty Wikipedia that dislikes the past) to tell you what you need to know. They feel like having been written this morning for you, and that's good. The only strange detail is that they don't add the year of publication of the original edition. Nevertheless for foreign books most of them are good enough, with excellent translations from the public domain too, at first I was a bit afraid of outdated translations (which happens in Lysistrata and The Art of War) but for the most part I have grown fond of them. I don't know the original novel in French but so far the translation seems neutral. A very recommended edition and I am grateful to these AmazonClassics editions to take me into a journey of so many classical works in literature, science, philosophy and essays by many talented men and women in the history. I plan to get many of the books of this collection in good physical editions as a legacy for others after me (is a curious thought to wonder what happens with your Kindle books when your life ends), if you want to read this story in a good edition the AmazonClassics edition is a good choice. This was one classic I just didn't get around to reading for the longest time -- I was familiar with its premise and had even seen bits and pieces of the mediocre Jackie Chan film based on it, but never actually read it myself. Ironically, I ended up finally picking up the book on a trip of my own, and read it on the plane. And while it comes across as a travelogue of its era at times, it's an entertaining story nonetheless, and a testament to one man's determination to traverse the globe in 80 days.

Phileas Fogg is a practical, logical man with very predictable habits... so it comes across as a shock to both his newly hired servant, Passepartout, and the gentlemen's club he belong's to when he takes up a wager that will have him seeking to circumnavigate the world in no fewer than 80 days! With the long-suffering but eager to please Passepartout and a lovely Indian woman in tow, Fogg sets out to circle the world by train, steamship, elephant, sled, and any other means he can. But his journey is not without its mishaps or complications... the worst being a detective who suspects the journey is a ploy by Fogg to get away with a crime, and seeks to stop his journey at all costs...

The writing in this book can come across as a little stilted, especially to modern-readers. I attribute this partly to the common writing style of the time period and partly to the fact that this book is a translation -- often writing styles get lost in the shift from one language to the next. The story still manages to move at a fairly steady pace, though occasionally it gets bogged down in odd places. The story comes to a screeching halt at one point to deliver a history of the Mormon church in Utah, for example -- interesting, but hardly pertinent to the story -- and at other points pauses to make copious notes about the geography and architecture of wherever they happen to be. This makes it come across almost as a travelogue at times.

Fogg is a hard character to get to like at first -- so logical and seemingly without feeling that he's hard to relate to. His valet, Passepartout, is a much more relatable character, a hapless everyman dragged along in his master's footsteps but still willing to please. And as the story progresses Fogg reveals a warmer side to his personality, and gradually shows himself to be heroic as well as determined and not without sympathy toward others. And even Fix, the detective doggedly pursuing Fogg and his servant, is shown to be a decent character just trying to do justice as he sees it. The Indian woman who travels with them for much of the trip has little personality of her own, though -- she seems tossed in just to serve as a romantic interest. Ah well.

Also, a few bits included in this book are a little harsher in hindsight. An offhand remark about the number of bison blocking the train tracks and wishing they could just shoot them all can make the reader wince when they realize that bison were nearly driven to extinction in just such a manner...

While a little dated and slow to start, ""Around the World in 80 Days"" is still an entertaining adventure story, and while today one can traverse the world in a much shorter time, this is still a fascinating look at how it was done in centuries' past. And it's certainly a LOT better than the Jackie Chan film... Great book. The cover is really nice and came perfectly, the print and fond is also very enjoyable and it even comes with a string to mark the pages. Very satisfied Legal Yes, you heard me right.
Just like other Jules Verne works, this sci-fi classic fills you mind with wonderful and lively description of the world and the characters inside it. 無料で読めます。

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (AmazonClassics Edition),"On a drowsy afternoon by a riverbank, a young and distracted Alice follows a rabbit into a fantastical underground world that grows curiouser and curiouser. Dared, insulted, amused, and threatened by a succession of anthropomorphic creatures, the indomitable Alice falls deeper into a swirl of the imagination where logic has no place.
Referenced, resourced, analyzed, and embraced since its publication in 1865, Carroll’s masterpiece of the irrational has inspired such varied artists as Walt Disney, Marilyn Manson, Jerome Kern, James Joyce, and Tim Burton. It stands as one of the most extravagantly and ingeniously absurd works in the English language.
Revised edition: Previously published as Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, this edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I’ve seen many Alice and wonderland movies but this is a first for the original. Loved it and the photos made the characters very real I knew what I wanted to give a nine-year old for her upcoming birthday, ""Alice In Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"", just as an uncle had gifted me the books when I had been that age. I went onto three book-selling websites and searched for ""Alice in Wonderland"". I was very suprised at the number of options available. They ranged from expensive volumes with the original title, ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"", to abridged books with colorful modern illustrations.

I didn't have anything against any of them, except they weren't what I was looking for. I wanted child-friendly hardback books with original Tenniel illustrations, and I definitely wanted no abridgement. As novels go, these are not lengthy books anyway. And the puzzles and language are so wonderful, I wanted her to have the full story. These Lewis Carroll books are fantasy, but they are not simple or dumbed down!

""Take some more tea,"" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.
""I've had nothing yet,"" Alice replied in an offended tone, ""so I can't take some more.""
""You mean you can't take LESS"", said the Hatter: ""it's very easy to take MORE than nothing.""

I finally selected two companion hardback books from amazon, and I am very pleased with them. Both were published in 2007 by Digital Scanning, Inc. (DSI). They are about 10 high by 7 wide, kind of a cross between a novel and a picture book. The covers have wonderful colorized Tenniel illustrations. The inside pages have the original black & white Tenniel illustrations, described as ""from John Tenniel"" or ""after John Tenniel"". Tenniel's original illustrations were highly detailed woodcuts, and modern age mass-produced copies of his woodcuts have lost some of his original detail, but they are still the recognizable and beloved illustrations I remember. Here's the matching book for ""Through the Looking-Glass"".


All of the inside text pages have an imaginative decorative border around the outside, with images from the book. There are eight border designs in all and they added to my satisfaction with these books. I will say that in going through the pages, I found a couple instances where part of a border was smudged or faded, but they were rare and not enough to bother me.

Overall, I highly recommend the two DSI productions of Carroll's books. Introduce a young reader to Lewis Carroll's genius!

Happy Reader Enjoyable and quick read. Parts inside are, of course, a bit problematic and hard to read, though. The art truly completes it. Multiplicity of editions can be frustrating if you want to spend correctly just once. The AmazonClassics edition is a very good edition, almost perfect, it has X-Ray, the original illustrations in a good size, modern typography and a very polished formatting; except one part: there is a beautiful poem/tale, ""The Mouse's Tale"", in which a mishearing makes Alice to blend tail with tale and the story appears typographically in a quite beautiful shape of a tail, sinuously getting narrower til being as thick as an individual letter. Unfortunately in the AmazonClassics Edition the shape is rather like a sinuous river, it losses its meaning. I checked other kindle edition I have, ""Alice in Wonderland: The Complete Collection"" edition by Maplewood Books, the illustrations are a bit less clear (at least that was I felt), the formatting, although good, it's not as exemplar as the AmazonClassics Edition but to my tranquility ""The Mouse's Tale"" is formatted faithful to the original, so I will stick to that complete edition and I won't get the second book, ""Through the Looking-Glass,"" in the AmazonClassics Edition, for fear that it will not express the intentions of the author.

Peculiar book. Although built of meaningful blocks of events, as a group they are surreal; if there exists a meaning, is meant for only an initiated in the reasons of the story. For what I read it could be for the amusement of a little girl friend of Lewis Carroll. I love it very much. Weird and all, inscrutable and unfathomable as it is to me at the same time it is exciting and mind blowing. Alice falls into another world, one that changes like a dream but whereas we as actors of our dreams change along them. Instead Alice lives them quite consciously, as one of those old memories of strange events or creatures you saw, in which you are not that sure if it actually happened or, being that fantastic, it was a reverie feed by being in an unfamiliar place. Okay, I admit to reading this after playing Alice: Madness Returns. I was in the mood for some classic literature too!

Having never read this, I didn't know what to expect. Rather than having a cohesive story with a beginning, middle and end, like the nature of the writing, things are a little bit...bizarre. We have a collection of scenes which Alive stumbles her way through with (let's face it) atrocious intro and conclusion tacked on. These are so brief (a few paragraphs) that do nothing. In fact, I know this is an older story, but the ending is awful. Maybe it hadn't been done to death in Carroll's day?

Despite my contemporary complaints, I actually feel the story would be better off without the intro and conclusion, and be left as a collection of very strange conversations.

Okay, there are dialogue heavy with some great images and everything is twisted and fired back and forth, but even this gets a bit...repetitive. It's easy to see why the tea party scene is so famous however, as the writing and humour here is superb. Though I have problems with this, I can recommend the book for this scene alone!

In summary, it was good to read something a bit different and the language is approachable and it's all very, very silly. Good to dip into. Just ignore the after-thought ending. Makes one wonder about the creative process for such a tale. There is so very much to explore and discover. Compared to any movie about Alice that I ever viewed, I find that actually reading the work is so much more rewarding. Some words and expressions must be researched to get the meaning. And I do so enjoy the language of the time. J'aime énormément, c'est super. Et les pages coupées à la main rendent super bien. J'adore et je prendrais d'autres livres de cette édition.
Oui, c'est en anglais.

C'est arrivé rapidement, en moins d'une semaine. J'avais acheté ce livre ainsi que leur édition de Peter Pan. Excelente libro, una pieza increíble de colección. I think clearly the author was high and happy when writing the story. There is so much of joy and wonder in the story which amuses me each and every time I have picked up this book. This is a homage I pay to my best friend Shivani someone who had always love this book and this month when we celebrate our birthdays I am remembering her and thinking about all the joys and magic she brought into my life. Ich kann mich hier den positiven Stimmen bloß anschließen! Ich lese gerne und viel, gerne Englisch und gerne Klassiker und komme darüber hinaus aus einer ""Künstlerfamilie"", weshalb ich mich auch für dieses Buch mit den Originalillustrationen entschieden habe!
Das Buch ist sehr liebevoll gestaltet und verfügt über einen Umschlag welcher ebenso bedruckt ist wie das unterliegende gebundene Buch. Die Geschichte ist wundervoll, was ich wohl kaum erwähnen brauch, und ein erfrischend tiefgründigeres und liebevolleres Erlebnis als entsprechende (leider mehr verbreitete) Verfilmungen. Auch für Kinder zum Englisch lernen oder als Gute Nacht Geschichte zur ersten Begegnung mit der englischen Sprache geeignet. Die Illustrationen sind wunderschön, passend, weit entfernt von solchem globalen Kitsch wie er heute in den meisten anderen neuwertigen Massenware-Kinderbüchern zu finden ist, und werden sowohl Erwachsene als auch Kinder erfreuen.
Und um es mit Alice's Worten zu sagen ""and what is the use of a book, without pictures or conversations?"" Zu diesem Fantasievollen Werk gehören sie einfach dazu.

Hier kauft man sich ein Stück Kultur, ein tolles Leseerlebnis, Freude und Bildung in einem. This is a great book! The pages are flat and not wavy, nothing damaged, beautiful illustrations."
Winnie-the-Pooh (AmazonClassics Edition),"Winnie-the-Pooh invites readers to join Christopher Robin and his beloved bear as they wander through a charming, open-skied environment full of possibilities. In their enchanting forest, Pooh and his friends follow their curiosity into beehives, Heffalump traps, a sailing expedition in an upturned umbrella, and more.
A. A. Milne’s bestselling marvel of invention explores the world through the eyes of an incredibly imaginative child—a world made all the richer by Milne’s humor and wisdom. Sensitive, playful, and endearing, the whimsical escapades of Winnie-the-Pooh have been treasured by generations of readers.
Revised edition: Previously published as Winnie-the-Pooh, this edition of Winnie-the-Pooh (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Best children's book ever. Wonderful characters and stories. A classic. Forget the Disney version, which is crap. This is the real thing. This book is an absolute delight. Obviously written for the kids, reading Winnie The Pooh as a fully grown adult brought back so many memories and feelings of complete and utter joy that it was like you had relapsed completely back into childhood.

Some stories were silly, some were brilliant but the star of the show was of course the best bear in the world, the most lovable, huggable, adorable, sweetest, most innocent bear ever brought into existence. It all came to a head for me when Pooh came up with the idea to save Piglet from a horribly wet encounter in the driving rain and so I defy any good hearted soul to read this story and not get emotional.

At one point the stories bordered on comic farce - in a good way, of course - and all but one of the characters are an absolute joy. Of course, we don't dislike Eeyore - but you kind of have to feel sorry for the silly donkey. But maybe that is the donkey's plot in life - to exist in a state of permanent dismay. Having never been a donkey myself, I can't say. But what I can say is that WINNIE THE POOH, Christopher Robin and the entire population of the HUNDRED ACRE WOOD is a landmark of western literature and should be placed alongside the great works of Tolkien, Asimov , George RR Martin and even Jordan, and so thanks must go to the brilliant A A Milne for having the intellectual foresight of creation, and also thanks be to Amazon for making such an awesome reading experience available at such a low price.

Greggorio (LR) This review is for A.A. Milne Winnie The Pooh (specifically book 1 AmazonClassics Edition available on K. U.) Although I own many hardback and paperback versions

I adore The Winne the Pooh series. My first set was the paperback edition with water color like illustrations before surgery when I was four with my own Pooh, Eeyore, and Tigger. It helped my wait and recovery time. They accompanied me through many other surgeries. So this why these stories mean comfort to me even today.

I had not read a Pooh Story on kindle yet so when it was recommended it was downloaded immediately.

This version has black and white sketch illustrations similar to my scholastic book paperbacks (similar to the cover) for those who want to know the kind of artwork inside. This book does have auditable but I never use this feature. I prefer to do my own reading.

To me the stories are all sweet tales of good friendships that are heartwarming for all ages. Would highly recommend to others. We had these books on tape several years ago for our older kids, so when we added a baby this year we knew that the cd's had to be found for him. We looked all over for them, and were so happy to finally find them on Amazon! Peter Dennis is the perfect narrator for the Pooh stories (the real Christopher Robin certainly agreed!), so even though we found the books on cd by other narrators before finding these, we chose to wait until the Peter Dennis set could be found. He does such a wonderful job on the voices of the characters, and he switches back and forth so naturally and smoothly that he makes listening to the books a true pleasure. Not only are the cds soothing and fun to listen to for the baby and for the kids, but they're also fun and nostalgic to listen to for the parents. They aren't annoying to listen to like a lot of other kid-oriented cds can be.

If you're looking to give your child some listening enjoyment that won't hype him or her up with too much craziness, and you love the classic beloved Pooh Bear, then these are for you! I think I’ve seen and heard nearly every adaption of Winnie-the-Pooh over the years, but never the original source material. What can I say that hasn’t been said already in the near 100 years this book has been out? Literally nothing, so I don’t. Except, it’s a great whimsical antidote for stressful days and/or times.

Give it a go if you never have! The 75th anniversary edition of Winnie-The-Pooh is in excellent condition. However, I was disappointed that the part telling the special edition is just on a sticker on the cover of the book. I had expected it to be printed on the cover. Favorite book of my childhood. This edition is very high quality. The stories are a delight for both the child listener and the adult reader. There are so many humorous things in the visual writing of the stories that amuse an adult reader and keep both adult and child equally engaged in the story. Odd spellings and Important Capitalization are frequent humorous touches to keep the reader amused. The stories do have great lessons on friendship, simple pleasures, expectations, acceptance, but they also reflect the vivid fantasy world and imagination of a child and of the father who can interpret it. Mr. Milne did a fine job of translating the real Christopher Robin's imaginary world into a collection of classic stories for children, parents, teens, non-parents and basically anyone. These stories and characters stay with you through a lifetime. When I was expecting my son, my friends gave me a Hundred Acre Wood Baby Shower, because, unknown to me, I had mentioned Pooh enough times that it was noteworthy. Also, BTW, the authentic Pooh and friends toys are on display at the NYC childrens library in Manhattan. Me and my son have been there with our own Pooh Bears for a photo. It's a children's book, but it's worth reading at any age. The stories are sensitive, and they can bring some light reflection on life. It's a nice reading before bed. Compré la version original y traducción al español y lo estamos leyendo a los hijos para que aprendan el inglés. Les ayuda mucho プーのお話が大好きで、英語でも読んでみたい、いつも手元に置いていたい、カラーの挿絵がいい…ということでKindle版にしました。
英語版の文章は綴りがプー達の使う単語のわざと間違っていたりして逆に難しい気もしますｗ My 7 yr old loved the book. He is a slow reader and just about getting into the habit. Good but if you are looking for your kid to get into reading. Almost thought I wouldn't get it in time but the book is stunning, it feels really good, and I got it a lot earlier than Amazon initially told me it would take!!! Thank you Amazon!"
The Woman in White (AmazonClassics Edition),"Art teacher Walter Hartright is on the road to London when he encounters an enigmatic woman dressed entirely in white. She’s an unnerving portent of strange things to come as Hartright starts a new job as drawing-master at Limmeridge House. There the teacher falls in love with Laura, his betrothed pupil, who bears a striking resemblance to the woman in white. Soon Walter is drawn into a family intrigue of greed, secrets, madness, and revenge.
Written in the form of testimonies, letters, and diary entries, Wilkie Collins’s gothic epistolary novel is regarded as the first “sensation” mystery. More than 150 years later, it continues to keep readers guessing.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Woman in White, this edition of The Woman in White (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This is another of those books that I've long intended to read but somehow never got around to. My resolution for 2017 is to rectify some of that neglect.

The Woman in White is in the grand tradition of the densely plotted Victorian novel. It is, in fact, downright Dickensian or Jamesian in its wordiness. Modern readers who have not been exposed to the circuitous descriptions and verbiage of such writers may falter over its 600+ pages. But lovers of the language may find themselves drooling, as I did, over its skillful use.

The story starts with a young drawing master, Walter Hartwright, encountering a mysterious woman dressed all in white as he walks along a moonlit London road. The woman is in distress and asks for directions which Walter gives her and sends her on her way. Soon after, he hears a policeman asking if anyone has seen the woman, who, he says, has escaped from an asylum. Walter keeps quiet and the policeman's search is unsuccessful.

Walter has been engaged to teach drawing to two young ladies at Limmeridge House in Cumberland; Laura Fairlie, fair, gentle, pretty, guileless orphan whose guardian is her uncle, the hypochondriac/narcissist Frederick Fairlie, and Marian Halcombe, Laura's elder half-sister and companion, dark, strong-willed, intelligent and resourceful.

Over the next few months, Walter and Laura fall in love, but Laura has already been promised (by her deceased father) to Sir Percival Glyde, Baronet, and she is determined to honor that commitment. Marian, understanding the impossible situation, advises Walter to leave the country to get over Laura. With the help of a friend, he secures a position with an archaeological expedition headed to South America.

Laura, much to her sorrow, marries Glyde. It is clear from the beginning that Glyde is a villain, although it isn't certain at first just what his villainy entails.

When the honeymooners return from a trip to Italy, they have Count and Countess Fosco in tow. Count Fosco is Glyde's closest friend and his wife - surprise, surprise! - is Laura's aunt, who was estranged from the family over the matter of a bequest.

It soon becomes clear that both Glyde and Fosco are ""embarrassed"" financially and their only hope of redeeming themselves is to call on Laura for a loan from her inheritance. Her husband attempts to pressure her into signing papers that would authorize the funds, but, with Marian supporting her, she refuses.

How can the nefarious duo get the funds they need? Well, if Laura were dead...

Collins' complicated plot over the next few hundred pages explicates very clearly the inequality in law of women and men at that time. A woman was under the control of her father or her guardian until she married and, once married, she was under the thumb of her husband. A married woman could hardly do anything without her husband's consent. She had little recourse in the courts of the time.

Willie Collins was trained in the law and he understood this very well. He created a strong and empathetic female character in Marian Halcombe and yet, resourceful as she was, she had little hope of combating the villainous Glyde and Fosco without the manly assistance of Walter Hartwright. Perhaps I was particularly sensitive to this theme, having just completed reading The Bell Jar, but it seemed to me that this book could be read as a 19th century feminist treatise.

Collins effectively uses the multiple narrator strategy of telling his story by offering witness statements from all of the principal characters, much as would happen in a court of law. In spite of its length, its complicated plot and its 19th century verbiage, this is a real page-turner of a book. I found it hard to put down and I could not wait to see where the twists and turns of the plot would take me next.

As an early example of the mystery novel, with Walter Hartwright standing in as the everyman detective, this sets a high bar for later writers of such novels to reach. Indeed, this has been included on some lists of the greatest novels of all time, and I would not argue with that assessment. All the contrived intrigue and interesting characters of a minor Dickens work, with little of the humor, pacing, or satisfaction, it is still a wonderful insight to the contrived plotting of Victorian literature. Fun to read for a Dickens fan and anyone interested in the era. Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White is an excellent suspense novel written over 100 years ago. It's 650 pages, and has the relatively wordy passages indicative of that era. How then, you ask, could it be that suspenseful? My response: Read it and see! I found myself reading 200 pages a day in it, simply refusing to put it down, as I HAD to find out what happened to these characters.

And speaking of characters, what about them? Victorian novels are renowned for their character development, and this one is no exception. The protagonist, Walter Hartwright--a drawing instructor--is the perfect English gentleman, sometimes maddeningly so. While he explains what is happening and the proper course of action, the villains are running around wreaking their havoc. Walter's partner in good is Marian Halcombe, the driving force of the novel. She's more decisive than Walter, more courageous, and more determined than anyone else. Think of her as Scarlett O'Hara, but without Scarlett's flaws. At one point the villain even says that as long as Marian is against him, he must work harder than ever before! The villain himself, Count Fosco, is one of the most wonderful creations in literature. Collins melds the character--a mass of contradictions--perfectly, creating the consummate villain: witty, urbane, knowledgeable, always ahead of the good guys, and seemingly able to be in two places at one time. The only weak character in the novel is Laura, around whom the plot revolves. However, even though everything hinges on her, she's not actually in the novel that much, so her lack of development is barely noticed.

The novel, as other reviewers have said, requires some suspension of belief. Two unrelated women look like twins. One of them changes so much from grief that her family doesn't recognize her. People happen to be frequenlty at just the right place at the right time. However, none of this seriously detracts from the novel. The suspense is marvellous!

The plot is very complex. In a very brief synopsis, Marian and Laura become the victim of an apparent perfect crime. They and Walter must find a way out of it, as a mysterious woman in white (the titular character) seems desperate to share a secret with them. Is it what they need? The novel, however, is so much more than that! As twenty narrators provide their parts in events first-hand (one picks up as the other leaves off chronologically), the suspense mounts!

Bottom Line: Get this excellent suspense novel, and don't let the length or publication year deter you! The Victorian Era adds to the great characters, each of whom is so real that I made comparisons with people I actually know. The language, while somewhat stilted, is quite readable and intriguing, and in no way, deters from the suspense. You'll find yourself unable to put the book down; there's a reason it hasn't gone out of print in 150 years! I bought this because my granddaughter had selected it to read as an example of a (non-Dickens) Victorian novel, and thought I'd read it alongside her. Not realising its heft, I was surprised when it landed with a thwack on the doormat (my copy has 756 pages) a couple of weeks ago, but I cracked it open and began to read. I was consumed by the story immediately. Our hero, Walter Hartright (even his surname indicates his character: solid, dependable, devoted) meets the eponymous woman on p20 in a superb set-piece in the middle of Hampstead Heath in the middle of the night (""every drop of blood in my body was brought to a stop by the touch of a hand laid lightly and suddenly on my shoulder from behind me"").

The story unfolds from that point but, even though it's named for her, she remains in the background for almost all of it: a shadowy, mysterious figure who has something to do (we're not quite sure) with Sir Percival Gylde, our antagonist. Sir Percival is a thoroughly bad hat (even if we're initially unaware of that on our first meeting, it's telegraphed by the way a little dog shrinks away from him on p149), but - this being a Victorian novel - he's addressed in charming discourse, e.g., ""I hope, Sir Percival, you don't do me the injustice to suppose that I distrust you"" [p148]. He's aided (we initially think) in his dastardly efforts by Count Fosco, who turns out to be the most remarkable and memorable character in the story, from his physical portrayal - ""He sat by the piano, with his watch-chain resting in folds, like a golden serpent, on the sea-green protuberance of his waistcoat"" [p328] - to the things he says, such as ""Allow me to present myself, Mr Fairlie [...] I come from Blackwater Park, and I have the honour and the happiness of being Madame Fosco's husband. Let me take my first and last advantage of that circumstance by entreating you not to make a stranger of me"" [p406]. The other main character is Marian Halcombe, who begins to suspect and fear Count Fosco after a while; there's a nice after-dinner scene in the drawing room where Fosco is begging that ""the lovely dying light might not be profaned, just yet, by the appearance of the lamps"" and asks Marian (who's narrating this part of the story) to ""support his protest against the lamps"". She comments ""If any one of them could only have burnt him up at that moment, I would have gone down to the kitchen and fetched it myself"" [p328].

There are other flashes of humour in this suspenseful mystery, mostly connected with the portrayal of Mr Fairlie, who epitomises laziness and selfishness, but is (of course) covered with an exquisitely constructed veneer of good manners and politeness: ""Mr Fairlie regretted that the state of his health, on that particular morning, was such as to preclude all hope of his having the pleasure of receiving me"" [p121]. When confronted with a tearful servant, because he ""distinctly objects to tears"", he instructs his valet: ""Endeavour to ascertain what she means"" [p391]. In a similarly diverting vein, there's a neat portrait of the minor character Mrs Vesey ""who never by any chance suggested the idea that she had been actually alive since the hour of her birth [...] it will always be my private persuasion that Nature was absorbed in making cabbages when Mrs Vesey was born, and that the good lady suffered the consequences of a vegetable preoccupation in the mind of the Mother of us all"" [p49]. And an elderly solicitor illustrates a disordered household by noting that the butler ""who was old enough to know better, brought [him] a bottle of port that was chilled"" [p176].

Along with the mystery and the humour, the tale contains much on the inequality between men and women. This is most explicit in the law of the time, but there are other observations inter alia - e.g. Marian rages to her sister on p204 that men ""are the enemies of our innocence and our peace - they drag us away from our parents' love and our sisters' friendship [...] and fasten our helpless lives to theirs as they chain up a dog into a kennel"". Later on, she tearfully vouchsafes to her sister the practical implications of that inequality: ""[d]rop by drop I poured the profaning bitterness of this world's wisdom into that pure heart and innocent mind, while every higher and better feeling within me recoiled from my miserable task"" [p209]. And on p366, Marian is forced to shed the constraints of her sex by taking off much of her cumbersome Victorian clothing (""in my ordinary evening costume I took up the room of three men at least"" [p366]) in order to perform a daring - and decidedly unladylike - action to uncover a fell plot.

Despite its length, I found the story remorselessly gripping - perhaps more so in the first, mysterious, part than the second (when it turns into an early example of detective fiction). This is partly because of the way it's written by several narrators, each of which has a distinctive voice, and some of which are more reliable than others. But in the end, it's the quality of the writing that appeals. Here's Hartright, thinking about someone who's dear to him: ""The woman who first gives life, light and form to our shadowy conceptions of beauty, fills a void in our spiritual nature that has remained unknown to us till she appeared [...] The mystery which underlies the beauty of women is never raised above the reach of expression until it has claimed kindred with the deeper mystery in our own souls"" [p53]. And, finally, here he's reflecting on someone's demise: ""So the ghostly figure [...] goes down into the impenetrable gloom [...] Like a shadow [they pass] away into the loneliness of the night"" [p646].

A wonderful story, strongly recommended. 岩波文庫にも翻訳されているので、手頃に読めるが、本書で英語に接して読んているうちに、さまざまな世界文学への扉がひろがる。私はこのショッキングノベルと称されているこの作品が後のラテンアメリカ文学へつながっているように思われる。たとえばホセ·ドノソとか、そうゆう勘違いを許すほどの貴重な作品。文章も読みやすい。時間に余裕のあるひとは熟読。おすすめ。 I LOVE the book, I was surprised to discover that it includes the play version of The Woman in White as well, which was first performed in 1871.

That's a great bargain for me. I love the cover, it is so pretty and asthetic! It also had fast shipping It's a shorter version and it's a good to go reading. Choosing hardcover ,no regrets!"
The Pilgrim's Progress (AmazonClassics Edition),"Plagued by spiritual anguish, devout everyman Christian fears his fate in the sinful City of Destruction. He’s told that only by embarking for the Celestial City can he achieve personal salvation. After his wife and children refuse to join him, he sets forth alone into the unknown. Mocked for his faith, tempted at every turn, and heartened by fellow pilgrims, Christian’s winding journey toward grace unfolds. But as he reaches Mount Zion, his family chooses to follow the same treacherous path, hoping to join Christian in the shining light.
John Bunyan began to write The Pilgrim’s Progress while in prison for nonconformist preaching. His dream-framed allegory, edited in 1909 by American clergyman Jesse Lyman Hurlbut, stands as one of the most profoundly influential novels ever written.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Pilgrim's Progress, this edition of The Pilgrim's Progress (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan is
2nd most published book in the history of printing (the Bible is, by far, the most published book in history). It was required reading in almost all American schools for centuries. If a book is continually in print and continually popular for almost 350 years, it probably deals with universal themes and serious issues to which everyone can relate, in ways that are both entertaining and profound. Such is the extended allegory Pilgrim's Progress.

Per Wikipedia: ""It has been translated into more than 200 languages and never been out of print...The first North American edition was issued in 1681. It has also been cited as the first novel written in English. According to literary editor Robert McCrum, ""there's no book in English, apart from the Bible, to equal Bunyan's masterpiece for the range of its readership, or its influence on writers as diverse as C. S. Lewis, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, Louisa May Alcott, George Bernard Shaw, William Thackeray, Charlotte Bronte, Mark Twain, John Steinbeck and Enid Blyton.""

If you haven't already, you really should read this book (preferably in the Banner of Truth edition). If you've already read it, perhaps you should read it again?

My copy shipped incredibly quickly, but it wasn't in ""Very Good"" condition (as it was described by the seller) when I received it. It was between ""Like New"" and ""New"" condition! Spot on. It's fabulous! And, Oh man, woman, and child, WHAT A GREAT BOOK!!! The book is used, but in very good to excellent shape. It is a hardbound edition with a leather appearing cover (I haven't tested it). The book seems to be intact and not torn or disfigured.

The text appears to be the original text in late 17th Century English. Some of the words and phrases are 'curious' compared to current English, but largely is not impossible or deceptive to read. (The same difficulty applies to the King James version of the Bible and the works of Shakespeare; probably other works as well.)

The story is an allegory of a Christian's life, encountering the distractions and perils of life in a hostile, or at least non-sympathetic world. All in all a solid work.

John Bunyan wrote this book while in prison for the crime of 'preaching without a license'. In England at the time, a 'preaching license' was issued by the Church of England - under authority of the Monarch of England. Issuance was predicated on agreement with and adherence to the then current teaching and doctrine of the Church of England. John Bunyan didn't agree or adhere. Instead, Bunyan was part of the Reformation movement, leading to what is now known as the 'evangelistic' theory of Christianity; and incidentally to the concept of religious freedom in the sense no one (quasi-political) group could control religious expression in a nation.

One notes the text and story line is fairly obvious. John Bunyan was not given to subtlety in either.

Recommended to all Christian believers, but probably not those who might consider Christianity as a way of life. It can be a bit daunting. In high school I was ‘made’ to read this book but 35 years later I have chosen to read it again. What a brilliant masterpiece writing, giving us a glimpse into the journey a follower of Christ takes in life on his way to his ultimate home: eternity with Christ! Character names and details were used so well to show the mountain highs and valley lows of this magnificent path. And at last the King addresses our main character, welcomes him into the Celestial City, and enjoys life ever after with those that have obeyed His commands and have put their trust in Jesus. It’s not a dream… I was spellbound while I read both books. The witness and confirmation of the Holy Spirit testify to the faithfulness of Bunyan’s writings as true to Biblical Christianity and the Road to Eternal Life. Highly recommended by this 78 year old retired Pastor who still remains available to preach about Jesus at any opportunity when invited. Written by English dissenter John Bunyan in the 17th century it would be deemed an important work in religious literature because of it's simplicity. The common people might not be able to understand the scriptures from the Bible or Book of Common Prayer but this story is easily understood even by children. My version includes a preface which tells a brief history of the author and it is most valuable and of interest. Bunyan writes as a narrator of a dream, a man called Christian (aptly named) leaves his home in the city of Destruction, where sin runs rampant and is about to be destroyed and sets out on a Pilgrimage to save his soul. Along his path he meets various people who all have meaningful names and they will either help or try to hinder him. Just as in life it's all about choices, Christian has to decide who to trust and who not to trust. The author also has many songs, poems and quotes within the story. The fact that Bunyan wrote this work rather than just bide his time in prison shows remarkable character and spirituality in the man, just reading this you can feel he is very passionate in his beliefs. Pilgrim's Progress is my favourite book after the Bible. I was delighted to see it in a pictorial version for children. My 2.5 year old loves it. It captures the imagination, but also offers so many teachable moments. There is a picture on every page, and the text is short but it still maintains a good flow and doesn't feel like much of the story is missing.
(Caution - there are some ""graphic"" scenes. Mostly when the character Faithful is martyred in Vanity Fair) Un classiqu qu'il fait bon relire still relevant insights for today. Pilgrims on the narrow road still face the same foes, obstacles, temptations, and yet are buoyed, sheltered and carried onward by the same power, love and grace as in the time of Brother Bunyan. Who knows but that there will soon be many more Christians writing from within prison gates in our Western societies. Exquisitely crafted allegory of life, beautifully written, a truly inspirational and instructive book. An epic journey of the mind through the land of free will. If ever you have asked yourself the question ""What the hell am I doing here and why?"" John Bunyan shows you how to answer your own question. What is so unique about this piece of writing is that you know the characters, and all the locations, intimately, before you start to read it. We all do. I cannot think of another book that achieves this and makes such good use of it. Twelve and a half years of his life in gaol for preaching without a licence. Read his story and find out why the powers were so terrified of him. I promise you, you will never feel alone again. Often reading hundred to two hundred fifty year old literature surprisingly left me shocked at how similar the language of this era was. A much easier read than expected despite its age. The moral tales are useful; although, in modern times I would expect anyone other than a Christian to rate it harshly.
I enjoyed this glimpse so far into the past and the application that can be made to life today."
Peter and Wendy (AmazonClassics Edition),"The Darling children of Bloomsbury have a secret. His name is Peter Pan, a mischievous night visitor who’s somewhere “betwixt and between” a boy and a bird and who refuses to grow up. When Peter invites young Wendy and her two brothers to follow him back to his Neverland home, an adventure beyond any bedtime story unfolds.
A world apart from its innumerable renditions, sequels, and spin-offs, Barrie’s Peter and Wendy is a strange, beautiful, dark, and complex fantasy about the “heartless innocence” of children, the bittersweet longings of adult nostalgia, and the realities and fears of growing up.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Peter and Wendy, this edition of Peter and Wendy (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This novel, written in 1911, by Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet, is truly a 'voyage through the language' of a true playwright. Not only a novelist, J.M. Barrie wrote multiple plays. Even considering this novel, Peter and Wendy; it appeared not only in novel form, but was was also adapted by Barrie for the stage. Born in Scotland, Barrie truly brought to life both Mr. And Mrs. Darling, as well as Nana, their prim Newfoundland dog (nurse), not to mention Captain Hook, Smee and of course Peter AND Wendy. A marvelous and exciting tale that takes readers Back in Time to a much younger . . . simpler day. This story will never grow old!! Like Peter Pan . . . This Is A Book That Will Never Grow Up !!! Recommended Reading !!! ALWAYS SEEK TO FIND YOUR HAPPY THOUGHT !!! Barrie’s `Peter and Wendy` is another classic book I re-read through the Amazon Classics series, and I was happy with the reading experience with the Kindle app.

The story of Peter Pan, the Darling children and the Neverland (with its pirates, Lost Boys, fairies,redskins) is a classic read, but I don't consider it a very well written book or one of the best children books.
`Peter and Wendy` is definitely a book to read with the mind of a careless innocent child. I personally think that if you read it with an adult mind you won't find subtleties and the story might seem confusing (although the oddities have some delightfullness). I don't think that the ""the bittersweet longings of adult nostalgia"" are properly explored... it's just pure fantasy and should be enjoyed like that.
If you already seen the Peter Pan animations, the book has nothing new to it (Disney did explore more stories than the ones included in the book). Peter Pan was a favorite when I was a child. It was a lovely thing to dream of a place called Neverland, where one may fly with fairies and splash with mermaids.

As an adult, you realize the truth of what Barrie himself once said… that he’d written a tragedy. Beautiful, selfish Peter, who forgets things so easily, has no realization of what he has cost himself, in his efforts to remain forever young. We realize it for him, and so the ending of Peter Pan is bittersweet, for we experience a fullness to our lives, that he will never know. Classic is the word I use for the Disney version, I loved so much to read the printed version of the movie. I tend to prefer the books which are the sources but in this case I felt it a chore. Whereas the movie is a cherished adventure of kids traveling to a fantastic land, the book portraits both reality and fantasy as miserable places. In our world you are condemned to get older (older in this context means to be blinder to magic) and be overwhelmed by your duties; in Peter Pan's world you are condemned to live adrift, without real happiness despite the vast amount of superficial joy. There is no middle point: Wendy's mother gets married just with the first man that appears at her door; Peter Pan chooses surrogate mothers but it's just for play, he doesn't really know or care about them as persons. It's a quite loveless and miserable universe in two worlds, I really doubt I had found joy in it if I had read it when kid.

The AmazonClassics Edition is excellent. It has X-Ray, a professional formatting and comfortable to real typography. If you want to read this book this is a highly recommended edition. This is a fascinating tour of the imagination. Seems like the author turned a dream to words. My favorite aspect of the story is the characters’ feelings about and relationships to their parents, particularly mothers. The narrator of this book has done an excellent job of differentiating the various characters and makes this an excellent book to listen to as well as read. Well worth a reread since my childhood. This is the original version approx. 150 pages with some indecipherable illustrations. Good read altho folks who aren't familiar with Victorian type prose may have some problems here and there.
Altogether a much more satisfying story than the Disney version. I gave this book five stars because the language is excellent and complex though it is a story for children. Even though we all know the story of Peter Pan, it is worth reading the actual book for the humor and adventure. Barrie described the adults as a bit foolish and the children have the wisdom to enjoy life. I picked it up because it was listed in ""1000 Books to Read Before You Did by Mustich. I really enjoyed reading, or should I say rereading this book that is one of my favorites. I will probably reread it again. ピーターパーン❗
面白かったよ。 Although slightly controversial today, this novel brought the childish feelings of magic and adventure back to me as I read it. Além da história em si, possui muitos temas relevantes para serem debatidos. Li com meu público no meu podcast INGLÊS FLUENTE PRA QUÊ? E gostei muito! Bought as a present. Very pleased. Excelente história!!!"
The Wind in the Willows (AmazonClassics Edition),"Mole, Rat, and Badger are Toad’s dearest friends even as the aristocratic amphibian’s wastrel ways get him into trouble. After being arrested and sentenced to jail, he returns to his ancestral home of Toad Hall to find it overrun with stoats and weasels from the Wild Wood. But his friends haven’t abandoned him yet. In fact, they’ve conspired to help drive the villainous vermin from his home.
Embracing themes of empathy and friendship under the most trying conditions, The Wind in the Willows follows the journey of its anthropomorphic characters through the changing seasons of the English countryside while providing life lessons that have endured for generations.

Revised edition: Previously published as The Wind in the Willows, this edition of The Wind in the Willows (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Some of the most beautiful scenery writing. A beautiful story of friendship and adventure and growth and going out of your comfort zone and seeing things from a new perspective. Loved it I'm writing about the BBC children's audiobook on CD that is currently one of the formats on this listing -- easily one of my favorites and I'm so happy to have finally bought it. I listened to it fairly often in my early teens, and got a nostalgic hankering for it recently that I couldn't fill, because the only copy in my library system was on cassette tape.

This is hands-down one of the greatest full-cast audio dramatizations of a children's classic, possibly being surpassed only by ""The Mind's Eye"" production of The Hobbit. Do not expect a word-for-word reading -- instead it is a condensed buffet for the senses that beautifully captures the *spirit* of the book. I laugh in delight every time at the ludicrous, pompous voice of Toad, the no-nonsense dry words of Badger, and of course Mole as he goes from nervous eagerness to a more self-assured animal. There is a very different voice for each part, nowhere do you have to wonder who's talking. And equally memorable are the little songs, the between-scenes music, and the many sound effects (who could forget the ""poop poop"" of the motorcar horns).

I always wish it were longer, but I used to listen to it on repeat while I was sewing, and it never lost its charm even after many listenings. I'm not British, but can perfectly imagine the brooks, the hedgerows, the country houses and woods...it makes me homesick for comforting places I've never been. Perfect road-trip-with-kids audiobook, especially for reluctant young listeners/readers who prefer movies, because this is very much like listening to a program with the screen off. After watching the Disney adaptation of this classic, I decided to read it for myself, and I'm glad I did. Here are my reflections:

When you watch the Disney animated film, the title seems to be a misnomer. Not so for the book. The book repeatedly references how the wind has a voice of its own, particularly in the fantastic, ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,"" chapter. The book seems to be a compilation of short stories, so you can skip some chapters entirely and not be left out of the plot. You can read the skipped chapters later if you so desire. They're wonderfully written, but to be honest, not much happens in them.

In the movie, Toad never steals a motorcar. In the book he darn sure does. He goes to prison justly, but for some reason after his friends help him recapture Toad Hall, he is no longer pursued by the police, even though he is no less guilty of his crime and is even moreso guilty because of his defiant escape. In this way, the book has a loose end that the movie by Disney corrects. Unfortunately Toad's character is slightly altered in the Disney movie because of the way it ties up this loose end.

The pace of the book seems to be very slow for a children's book and it's on quite a high reading level I would say. To me, this is surefire proof that literate kids 100 years ago were far more literate than literate kids of today. Harry Potter doesn't have near as high of a vocabulary level requirement as this book does. Most of the vocabulary is used to describe nature. Due to the slow pace of the book in which the narrator describes how beautiful the outdoors is, you really have to like nature to fully appreciate the author's intent. I don't know how many people in modern times really appreciate the outdoors. I sure don't. I hate mosquitos.

The use of metaphors in this book is extraordinarily beautiful. The moon is anthropomorphized and described as deliberately and intently struggling to shine through the clouds to help Rat and Mole in their search for Otter's baby. Also, making a trek to the South is compared to checking out of a hotel, and strong smelling sausage is described as singing of garlic. This Grahame guy was far more of an adult author than a children's author if you ask me.

I didn't really care for any of the characters other than Toad. I was saddened to see that he was left entirely out of many chapters. Toad was perfect comic relief. Sleeping way later than everyone else, not sharing his load of the work, claiming to do things he couldn't do, talking about how great he was, etc. The whole bit of Toad dressing as a washerwoman was great, and fortunately ate up a large chunk of the book.

The high points of the book are its great and masterful use of the English language including its beautiful metaphors, and the presence of the fun and amusing Toad. The only thing it has that may not be so appreciated is its slow pace. The animals sit down to a meal about 200 times during the book, and the preparations for the meals seem overwhelmingly detailed, making you question whether ""adventure"" is a proper word to use in describing what's going on.

This magnificent work seems targeted to upper class individuals who are bigger on manners and properness than action and suspense, although it does have a good amount of comedy. Great stuff, but not for Spongebob Squarepants fans. Nostalgia for my childhood some 77 years ago induced me to buy Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows: I was amazed to find I still enjoy the doings of Mole, Rat, Badger and Toad et al. I revelled in it when I was six, read it to my children who enjoyed it and still find the book fascinating. For this old coot It has kept its fascination, its wonder, the thrill of adventure, and fun. Even when I was young I sensed the brilliance of the writing, the excellence of Grahame's prose and poetry itself in the chapter The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,
Wind in the Willows is a classic yet with the decline in language in this daunting new world of bobble-headed humanity it will be ignored and forgotten. That ancient Roman Cicero complained as his world changed ""O tempora, O mores"" to which I add ""O (expletive deleted)"". Vor sehr vielen Jahren hatte ich „Wind in den Weiden“ gelesen. Dank des Wörterbuchs im KINDLE habe ich mich jetzt auch an das Original noch einmal heran getraut. Das Buch ist im englischen Sprachraum (zu Recht) ein Klassiker, in Deutschland leider weniger bekannt. Ein Indiz für den Einfluss dieser Geschichte: Das erste Album von Pink Floyd bezieht seinen Namen von einem Kapitel dieses Buches.

Es gibt Ausgaben mit wunderbaren Illustrationen. Meine kostenlose KINDLE-Ausgabe hatte leider keine, das einzige Manko dieser Version.

Das englische Sprachniveau war für ein vermeintliches Kinderbuch überraschend hoch und das Vokabular teilweise sehr speziell. Da war das Wörterbuch im KINDLE eine große Hilfe, aber manchmal auch überfordert. Da half dann nur noch Google.

Die Hauptcharaktere dieser Geschichte sind ein Maulwurf, eine Wasserratte, eine Kröte und ein Dachs, und es sind wirklich Charaktere, die man nie wieder (im ausschließlich positiven Sinn) vergessen wird.

Sehr zu empfehlen. Regalo de navidad Do you know that emotion...saudade. When your heart overflows with emotion from a memory of the past, that is what happens when you read beautiful simple storys. Bel libro abbastanza semplice ma ben fatto ! Con CD."
White Fang (AmazonClassics Edition),"Wronged by human and beast alike, White Fang has endured through brazen ferocity. An enemy of his kind, he is sold to a dogfighter who pits him against other canines to the death—until a Yukon gold hunter comes to his rescue and provides an opportunity for a new life. As the wolf in White Fang sleeps, kindness and compassion allow him to understand what it means to be in the confidence of man.
Considered both a companion and mirror to The Call of the Wild, this stirring adventure of friendship and survival reveals the conflicts between domesticity and instinct, as well as society and the natural world.

Revised edition: Previously published as White Fang, this edition of White Fang (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Probably one of Jack London's most famous works, second only to ""Call of the Wild,"" ""White Fang"" is, in many ways, both similar and opposite to ""Call of the Wild."" Both stories take place (mostly) in Canada's far north, and both show the capacity for both cruelty and kindness that exists in humankind. But while ""Call of the Wild"" is about a dog who is driven to embrace his inner wolf by the circumstances of its life, ""White Fang"" is instead about a wolf who finds his life shaped by the various men he encounters. And it's an often-brutal but thrilling and even beautiful story.

White Fang, the sole survivor of his litter and three-quarters wolf (his mother was half-wolf and half-dog), is accustomed to a life in the wild... so when he and his mother are captured by a Native American called Grey Beaver when he's still a pup, his first instinct is to flee. But he soon learns that trying to escape his new master means a beating, and so he reluctantly stays with Grey Beaver's camp. What follows is a brutal education in learning humanity's ways, trying to survive the bullying of the other dogs in the camp, and carving out his own lonely niche in the pack hierarchy. And as he grows up and his ownership changes hands, he learns that the only way to survive is to be as vicious and hard as the men who own him. But when a sympathetic dog musher buys him, can a kind heart and hands make up for years of cruel conditioning?

London's writing can come across as a bit stodgy and slow in comparison to modern-day writing, but I find that it can be both thrilling and thoughtful. He describes the Canadian wilderness with great care, showing both its beauty and its ferocity, and does the same with both the animals and the people who inhabit it. And he's quick to point out how such a wilderness can harden both men and animals to a terrible degree... but that a capacity for kindness still exists regardless.

The one thing that DOES make the writing a bit uncomfortable is some inherent racism (White Fang thinks of white men as being superior to Native Americans), but I take this more as a sign of the times in which the book was written than anything else. Also, if animal cruelty is a difficult subject for you, take care reading this book -- it doesn't shy away from the beatings, starvation, and other atrocities mankind can and does inflict on the animals it takes into its care. But it also shows how a kind and understanding soul can mend some of this damage, and go a great length towards making an animal's life better.

A great companion read to ""Call of the Wild,"" ""White Fang"" can be a gut-wrenching read, especially if you're an animal lover and can't stand animal cruelty of any sort in a book. But it's an affecting book nonetheless, and shows just how much a harsh or a kind hand can shape any creature... even a human. White Fang has always been one of the top five of my favorite books. I first read it when I was a child, and I think it made me fall in love with wolves.
Thank you Jack London. You were one in a million. Somehow, someway I managed to escape the mandatory reading of this book in school. And, for some reason, I've never seen any movie about it, either. I don't know how I would have felt about ""White Fang"" if I had read it when I was 12, but at 51 I was fully captivated!

White Fang is part dog, mostly wolf, born to the wild, but domesticated to man and not always treated well. The tale is told to his perspective, so dialog is sparse and the point of view is very interesting. How does a wolf/dog think? How does he perceive his world? Does he simply act on instinct, or can he reason to some degree? The credit to Jack London is that he doesn't really give White Fang supernatural powers, nor make him anything more than what he is: an animal who acts as such.

Yet, through all that White Fang experiences - the good, the bad, the horror - you do NOT want to give up on this guy! Some parts of this book were, and are, very difficult for an animal lover to read. I love animals, and have a special fondness for dogs, and there came a time when I doubted I was going to be able to finish this book. Yet, I am glad I perserved to the end and stayed true to White Fang and to the man who becomes the hero in the book, Weedon Scott.

Among the complaints of this book is that Jack London was too descriptive and wordy. To some that might be, but Mr. London knew how to set the scene and make it come alive. The reader is in the Yukon, in the woods with the indians, hidden in the lair with White Fang and his parents. One can easily visualize all of this in what really is a very short novel. Another complaint I've read is the language used. Mr. London wrote this book in 1906, and the vocabulary used is evidence of that. But the writing is simply beautiful, and some words, while a bit archaic, just add to overall mood of the book, in my opinion.

I thought this was a wonderful tale of a wolf's life, with all the happiness, trials, horrors, sadness, love, and redemption one could hope for. For me, White Fang was a character worth cheering for! I can't remember when I first read these adventure novels ... many years ago. I am glad I chose to read them again to "" look through the eyes"" of two types of 4-legged creatures ... during extreme living conditions. I am not sure these are novels for those not yet in their teens ....they can be very violent at times (actually many times). An interesting story. An early presentation of the cruelties surrounding dog fighting and why it must be abolished. Read it. Also, a good intro to Jack London’s writing. L'édition est simple et sympa et l'histoire est vraiment prenante, je vous le conseille, surtout si vous êtes fan des chiens/loups comme moi Una bella storia, per un bellissimo classico adatto non solo ai ragazzi ma imperdibile per chiunque ami le storie di animali e le atmosfere ""selvagge"". Si legge speditamente anche in inglese. Top! I got my book a litle damaged. But for such low price, the story is definetly worth your money. A very interesting book. It's worth your time! I first read White Fang as a reading obsessed child, probably when I was about ten. I remember I also read The Call of the Wild at about the same time. I remember I preferred White Fang to The Call of the Wild for two reasons: first, that it has a (relatively) happy ending and, second, because of the dog fight scene, when White Fang, who before had killed every dog put in his way, is defeated by the slow, plodding advance of a bulldog.

Rereading it many years later, if anything my enjoyment of the book increased. What a writer Jack London was. The prologue, of the two men at death’s edge trying to keep alive through the northern winter as they are pursued by a wolf pack, is as visceral a piece of writing as I’ve ever read. Then, as the focus switches to White Fang himself, Jack London proves that a great writer can break just about every writing rule out there.

One of the things they tell you when writing is show, don’t tell. If your hero is a crack shot, have him shoot the ace out of an ace of spades rather than just telling the reader he is a marksman. But in White Fang, Jack London does a lot – a lot! – of telling. He tells us White Fang’s inner life, his outer life, the life of the north, wild and human. He does this because he won’t succumb to anthropomorphism and give White Fang a personal voice: he is a wolf and does not speak. So London tells us what he thinks and feels and does, and he does this so well that the book makes one really believe that this is how an animal thinks and feels and behaves. If one reason to tell a story is to enter into a world that we cannot personally know, then White Fang does this as well as any story ever written."
The Hound of the Baskervilles (AmazonClassics Edition),"Sir Charles Baskerville is dead. His body was discovered on the grounds of his Devonshire estate, face frozen in fright, not far from the footprints of a large beast. The cause of death has been determined to be a heart attack, but family legend tells another tale, and Detective Sherlock Holmes is determined to uncover the truth.
So whodunit on the foggy moors of Baskerville Hall? In one of literature’s greatest original page-turners, the answer is a classic.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Hound of the Baskervilles, this edition of The Hound of the Baskervilles (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. It's called a classic for a reason. I think it was very good, not extremely suspenseful, but a solid mystery. Good story. The time period its set in as well as the place makes it even more interesting to read. Ill recheck my highlighs but I don't remember the famous Sherlock quote in this book. I liked the idea of being a twist from the classical haunted house, but with a extraordinary part, which is grounded to a very normal thing, that may be thought as greater when surrounded by fear.
The humble investigation techniques, make reading a breeze, entertaining and addictive. Worth the read for the ambience , landscape, and characters. Now I need to see the movie. 3 more words. I love Sherlock Holmes - the originals (like this), the spin-offs, the movies, the TV... He's such a fantastic character, it's hard to imagine a time when the concept of deductive reasoning was not de rigeur, both in life and in art, but once upon a time it was not - and it is stories like this one that helped popularize the concept. This is Conan Doyle at his finest - and, oddly enough I discovered, more about Watson than The Great Man Himself.

It's a creepy tale, oft-told and re-imagined, but the original version is a classic and not to be missed. I started working my way through the Holmes canon a while ago, but stumbled on the first two novels a bit (I'm obsessed with reading books in order) - then started reading a book that referenced this one and didn't want to ruin its mystery so decided to read it first. Am I ever glad I did - and if you're looking for a jumping-off point for Holmes, definitely recommend starting here rather than at the technical beginning... You won't miss anything by doing so; Holmes and Watson are so much a part of the popular imagination that everyone already knows the gist of their relationship, so you might as well start with what I (and many) consider the best novel and work you way in that way! You won't be sorry... This is, pure and simple, a great story! ...setting aside its place in the history of detective fiction, my opinion of this short novel is that it's only good, not great. The Hound of the Baskervilles rips along and is generally well put together, holding the attention of contemporary readers, but is no longer capable of conveying the fear and sense of dread by which Victorian readers, and many Conan Doyle worshippers since, were gripped. Moreover, I'll surmise that, apart from the most resolute Sherlockeans, readers nowadays will find the exertions and plots of the principal malefactors to be implausible, if not absurd, and the conclusion weak. Although Conan Doyle does not build the villain up to the dimensions of a criminal genius akin to his Moriarty, we are supposed to believe the criminal mind at work in this novel stimulates Holmes' investigative juices to a peak, with the sleuth twice remarking that ""this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel,"" and 100 pages later repeating the comment with an ""I tell you now again."" These manly, playing-fields-of-Eton enthusiasms in the end did not, however, seem to me validated.

Even so, I enjoyed the book and, at the behest of many dedicated friends and in light of a recent interest in Conan Doyle instilled in me by Julian Barnes in his 2005 historical novel, Arthur & George, I will continue to fill a gap in my literary education by reading the Sherlock Holmes stories...until I tire of the detective's arrogance and condescension. I recognize those two adjectives come with the Victorian package, and we're supposed to chuckle at Sherlock's casual dismissiveness and hauteur. But to many contemporary minds, a little bit of that will go a very long way. Sherlock Holmes has so thoroughly permeated the literary and pop-culture worlds that it's possible to be very familiar with the fictional man, the stories dedicated to him, and the tropes ascribed to him without ever having read one of his actual stories. And for a long time I was one of those people -- I knew plenty about Sherlock and even knew the basics of the plot to ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" (thanks, Wishbone), but had never actually read a Holmes story. ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" is my first Sherlock Holmes story, and while I already knew the basics of the plot, it was nice to read the original, and it was nicely suspenseful and full of twists.

When Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead on the moors near his estate, it's assumed he died of a heart attack. But the esteemed detective Sherlock Holmes suspects foul play, and so when Baskerville's nephew goes to claim the estate as the last surviving heir, Holmes sends his assistant Watson to accompany him and gather clues. Watson dutifully records the goings-on and the intrigues surrounding the estate and the surrounding farms and moors... but it will fall on Holmes to finally piece together the mystery. And when a dark legend surrounding the Baskervilles -- a legend concerning a demonic hound -- rears its ugly head once again, it remains to be seen if the famed detective can stop the legend from claiming another life...

Surprisingly, Sherlock Holmes is absent for a good chunk of this book. But Watson is a surprisingly likable protagonist, an everyman who may lack Holmes' brilliant mind but is still analytical enough to pick up clues, and who has a sense of empathy and kindness that Holmes can occasionally lack. And there's a surprisingly eclectic and fun cast of characters to be had in this story, from the hapless American transplant trying to get settled in a dreary English estate to the servants with their own dark secrets to the doctor with an eccentric obsession with skulls.

While I was familiar with this story going in (not surprising, as it's one of the most famous Holmes stories), it still managed to be a nicely chilling and suspenseful read. The writing style can feel a little antiquated compared to a lot of modern writing, especially thrillers, but it still manages to hold a lot of suspense and creeping horror, as well as some genuinely witty and humorous moments to lighten the mood as necessary.

The Sherlock Holmes stories have managed to stand the test of time, and for good reason. Hound of the Baskervilles is still a creepy and enjoyable read decades after it was first written, and is a great mystery story with a dash of possibly-supernatural elements to liven it up. A truly wonderful hbk edition of the Hound! Very high-quality! A spy story so complex, diabolical and compelling that it kept me yearning for time to read and finish it. At first, the supernatural and macabre setting of a hound from Hell didn't sit well with me, especially when it's a Sherlock Holmes book, known for Arthur Conan Doyle's scientific way of writing, each and every aspect based on fact. The phosphorus element laid my suspicions to rest much later in the tale. Every aspect of horror and suspense as one would expect in a spy story spiced with Dr Watson has been written masterfully. A must read for all who value such old classics. 状態が良いものと聞いていたのですが、完全に古本の虫が付いており、あたり良いとは思えませんでした…
ただ原本の内容を見れたのは本当に嬉しかったので、星4の評価にさせて頂いております。
あと、完全に私事ではございますが、名前の読みを間違っておいででした。 I remember reading this book as a child and being completely entranced. So I decided to pick it up again and see if it moved me just as much. And it did! I could hardly put it down, my heart racing with anticipation and dread as the mystery unfolded. The only difference is that this time I somehow knew who the culprit was, and that I chalk up to my Holmes-like intuition, as opposed to childhood memory! 😊 I love this book. I have read a few of the other Sherlock homes books but this was by far the best. It was so cunning and thrilling and I just loved the whole storyline!"
The Jungle Book (AmazonClassics Edition),"Orphaned as a baby, human-boy Mowgli is adopted by wolves, befriended by Baloo the bear, and educated in the wonders and dangers of the Indian jungle. But the adventures of The Jungle Book don’t end with the young man-cub and his unusual new family. Through tales of Kotick the White Seal, Rikki-tikki-tavi the mongoose, and others, readers learn about courage and survival, rules and order, principles and morals, coming-of-age, and the thrill of self-discovery.
Rudyard Kipling’s fables reflect both his childhood in India and his vivid imagination, while exploring the relationship between civilization and the wild.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Jungle Book, this edition of The Jungle Book (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I don't know if the India that Kipling transmits is the India of his time. But it's a meaningless question. Art, with time, remains more real than the debris left by history: we love and know more about Don Quixote than Charles V. And so the India of Kipling is totally real to me, as are my Indian friends. Except that in Kipling with a touch of the British spirit of its time to, not only control the world, but to make it theirs. If you read the fiction of most of writers from the former countries of the Spanish Empire you will notice that, despite centuries of ancestors living there, they write about nature and natives as if they were something terrible and alien; Kipling instead embrace, and makes us embrace, the whole of India with deep love.

Although Disney movies could make you think otherwise, this is a unique book of tales and songs with different protagonists, mostly animals, and certainly not only Mowgli. An exotic book as Bollywood movies are today, with their stories and their dances in between. I loved so much the descriptions of Bagheera, a sensuous shadow of velvet. The jungle so dense and so old. The ocean and the wars to survive in ""The white seal."" Conflicts fueled by familiar bonds in ""Rikki-Tikki-Tavi,"" a tale in which I don't think there is really an enemy. The almost supernatural call in ""Toomai of the Elephants."" The last one, ""Her Majesty's servants"", I consider it more comical and maybe satirical. It was nice, but I didn't liked so much as the rest.

This AmazonClassics Edition has X-Ray, although when I consult the entry for Rann the kite, it gives me instead the description of a place instead of the character. Also, with many exotic terms, some of them are not explained in the X-Ray section. Maybe they are evident for most of the readers but I would liked to have a bit more data. In the end there is a short biography and that's all. There is no intermediary to spoil the fun, with introductions or studies, to read this great book that you can enjoy and learn at any age. This was one of my favorite stories from childhood and I must admit that it hasn’t lost its appeal. The Jungle Book is the story of the little man cub who gets separated from his family by the tiger Shere Khan. The little man cub toddles into the wolf pack straight to the strong mother wolf who is charmed by the fearlessness of the naked little creature. Mother Wolf decides they will keep the small cub, name him Mowgli after the frog, and present him to the pack. Of course Mother has to chase off Shere Khan first, which makes Mother very fearsome and the tiger look rather pitiful.

Baloo the bear stands for the man cub at council and promises to teach him Jungle Law and Bagheerah the black panther bought Mowgli’s life with the price of one fine large bull.

Akela, the wise old leader of the pack decided that it was good to have a man cub in their pack, for they were known to be very clever and fierce. He was sure that one day, the cub that was hunted by the tiger would be the hunter of the tiger and would bring his skin to Council Rock.

The personalities of the jungle kingdom were so fun, and I can’t imagine anyone not enjoying this book. It is written in beautiful prose with a loving hand and this will likely not be the last time that I read it. Cute quick read f a classic book and movie. Recommended classic for sure. Reads pretty identical to the movie which I liked most. For some reason, when I picked up this book to read it a year or two ago, and saw that it was a collection of short stories, I put it aside. It was not that appealing. But after subsequently thinking more about it, I found that I was grossly mistaken in my hasty judgment of it, and I now feel that it is one of the best books I've ever read.
I have never described a book in quite this way: 1. It has power. The narrative is powerful in and of itself. 2. It has beauty. It is beautifully written, the choice of words just right, the narrative flows smoothly in each story.
Normally, in some other book that has animals conversing with one another, we would have to consciously suspend judgment about this unheard of phenomenon and just say to ourselves, well, animals don't talk, as such, but we'll pretend they do for the sake of the story.
But The Jungle Books are so interesting and believable that not for one second did I doubt that the animals could in fact have the conversations as set forth in the book. To me, as the reader, it was perfectly natural to read ""animal dialogue"", and I found this striking: i.e. that I was hardly even aware that there was anything unusual about putting words in the mouth of beasts. The narratives are extremely realistic.
This is how powerful this collection of stories is. It actually transcends the issue of believability and/or likelihood of a particular thing happening or not-----it is a collection of stories quite unlike any other. I don't think there is another collection of stories like this, not with this high quality.
I highly recommend this collection of stories, First and Second Jungle Books.
Without a doubt one of the very best works I've ever read, and I read probably 40 or 50 books each year. Me la regalaron en VHS cuando era niño y desde entonces la amo, mi película favorita de Disney. Luego me compré la edición especial en dvd. No pude resistir y me compré ahora el bluray.😆 No llegó con cartoncito (ni sé como se llama) que va arriba de la caja de plástico, pero a mí no me importa eso. 10/10 😎👍 My son liked it Ich muss wirklich sagen, ich war zunächst sehr skeptisch ob ich das Buch wirklich lesen sollte, aber da es so schön aussieht habe ich mich dann entschieden es zu kaufen.
Das Dschungel-Buch ist ein zeitloser Klassiker, der nicht nur für Kinder schön ist.
Die Geschichte unterscheidet sich sehr von dem alten Disney Film, den die eigentliche ""Mogli-Geschichte"" spielt nur eine kleine Rolle.
Was diese Geschichte so einzigartig macht, ist die Unschuld die hinter den einzigen Handlungen steckt, so werden Menschen von den Tieren in Ruhe gelassen, weil diese keine Krallen haben um sich zu wehren und das wäre ja unfair.
Alles in Allem hat sich der Kauf wirklich gelohnt, da das Buch sowohl zum Lesen als auch zum Ansehen sehr schön ist. Beautiful version of this Rudyard Kipling classic. The colouring of the cover is a little different than pictured and there is less colouring in than I had expected but in all a great book. Estou ainda usufruindo da leitura desse livro. Recomendo a sua compra."
Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant (AmazonClassics Edition),"In this epic 1885 work, General Ulysses S. Grant, eighteenth president of the United States and staunch supporter of the Union cause, set the record straight on his storied life and career. At its heart is Grant, victor and eyewitness to the defining moments of the Civil War, including the Battles of Shiloh, Chattanooga, and the Wilderness; the Siege of Vicksburg; and the Appomattox campaign, which concluded with the surrender of Confederate general Robert E. Lee.
Featuring maps, illustrations, and personal correspondence, Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant reveals the candid, often witty, and pragmatic military genius as one of the most vital observers of war and peace in the history of American letters.
Revised edition: Previously published as Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, this edition of Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I bought the unabridged Audio CD, which is a huge bargain and played great in my car CD player.

I read 2 biographies about Grant first and then this autobiography. The biographies were by Chernow (first) and Brands (second). Between those 2, I recommend the Brands book. But I think this autobiography is better because you are hearing Grant's own words. It will show you that Grant was truly a brilliant guy. It's like you are there as it happens. He tells you why it happened, what happened, and what he was thinking.
He wrote this book when he was dying with cancer, but you can tell he had a brilliant mind and that he was a very good guy. I read a lot of history and of all the people in American history, I think Grant is my favorite and I have great respect for him. This book gave me a much better understanding of the events and thinking that led to the Civil War, or as Grant called it ""the Rebellion"". Grant had compassion and during the war, he helped the ""Freed Men"".

After he left the Presidency, Grant was in great financial shape until he was swindled and lost everything ($750,000) - he only had about $100 left. Shortly after that happened, he learned he had incurable throat cancer (probably from the cigars). Can you imagine? Most people would have given up - but not Grant. How could Mrs. Grant avoid poverty? Mark Twain was a friend of Grant's and offered Grant 70% of the profits if he would write an autobiography. Grant forced himself to write it even though he was dying - he died a week after finishing the book. It was a huge success. It made $350,000 for Mrs. Grant - a HUGE amount of money in that day (like $10 million today). Grant died shortly after completing the book. I have a lot of respect for Mark Twain for helping Grant by giving him a MUCH better deal than anyone else would have given Grant.

I enjoyed this Autobiography very much and felt like I was listening to Grant. One thing I didn't know was how some of the U.S. cabinet officers were traitors and helped the South. For example, just before the war, Secretary of War Flood moved weapons to the South and left them weakly guarded. When the war started Flood became a Confederate general.
Also, I was shocked to learn that the South had better rifles than the North.

Grant was an AMAZING guy - brilliant, honest and good in every way. I think he's one of the most important people in US history - definitely Top 10 - with Washington, Franklin, Lincoln, etc. He's a great role model.

Grant didn't want to be a general - he wanted to be a math teacher. He was good with numbers and his early experience in the army was as a quartermaster. When the war started, he volunteered because it was his duty. He was promoted because he was smart, organized, brave and a good leader who won battles. His promotions were merit-based, not due to political connections, as happened during the war - for example, General McClernand was a politician who became a general and he was not a good general. 2 of the first victories of the War were Fort Henry and Fort Donelson. It was Grant's idea to take those forts - he saw the opportunity, planned the attack, and managed it. He was opportunistic. It started out to take Fort Henry but he saw an opportunity to also take Fort Donelson, and he did. Vicksburg was the key to the War because it controlled the Mississippi River. It was considered a Fortress that couldn't be captured, but Grant captured it in July 1863. The 1862 elections had gone badly for the Republicans and voluntary enlistments had ceased. When you read the details of the Vicksburg Campaign you will realize that Grant was a military genius - like a chess master, except that the battle was much more complicated and sometimes Grant wasn't aware of where the enemy was or their strength.

You will see that the North would NOT have won the Civil War without Grant - at the least the North would have made a deal with the South to allow them to keep slavery, because the voters in the North were getting tired of the War. Without Grant's victories, Lincoln would have probably lost in the 1864 election - Grant's victories gave Americans hope. When you read the Autobiography you will see that Grant was a good, humble, fair, honest, dependable guy and that he was a military genius. He was like a Chess Master and could comprehend what was happening and all the alternative courses of action and their consequences, AND he was aggressive. Most of the other Generals would NOT follow up an advantage - they would stop and rest, giving the Confederates an opportunity to escape or entrench. The 2 top generals before Grant (Halleck and McClellan) were that way - they weren't aggressive and wouldn't seize opportunities - they couldn't see the opportunities that Grant saw.
I think if Grant had been in charge, the North would have won the war within one year.

I didn't understand the importance of logistics - it's critical because without food and ammunition the North would have lost. Grant writes about it from his actual orders for the various battles and explains the challenges.

I like and respect Grant very much. That's why I'm writing this review - Grant deserves more credit than he gets.

You will also learn that Sherman and Admiral Porter were critical to winning the War, that Lincoln was a good guy, and that Stanton was a jerk. Much has been said lately of the Civil War. Grant's Civil War autobiographical has been on my read list for some years, so it seemed timely to visit the place and time after Grant's statue was toppled recently. I do not doubt that Grant's words are NOT on the reading list of this era's MSM and revisionist historical recollections.

The book is written for and was a best-seller among veterans and general readers of both sides. It passed muster with the combatants. Grant's narrative is amplified on Kindle, providing easy search of names and places. In several engagements, the place names have changed since the events, and one wonders if they are not perhaps lost in history.

Grant pulls no punches clearing up the matter of what the Civil War was about. It was over the slavery period. Grant, in crystal clarity, describes the reason and rationale of ending slavery at that moment in US history. That was the whole of the Civil War. There was no US future as had been demonstrated in the admission of new states under the dual politics of slave vs free. No other reasons cited to this day approximately approach the force of ending slavery, as told by Grant. Revisionist historians claiming the Civil War was not about slavery at all are ignorant, liars or both. If Grant's word had not rung true when this narrative became a global bestseller, it would have never been a bestseller.

Grant is never seen to admire rebel generals as hero's. He knew most of them from West Point and the Mexican War. One by one, Grant correctly judges and anticipates his opponents with unnatural canny and defeats them. Every one of these generals was a traitor in Grant's cold accounting. That Northern MSM of the day championed rebel generals, lied about confederate casualties and bemoaned equally erroneous high Union body counts. The MSM hated Lincoln.

Grant has a special place for treasonous Northern journalists. Credentialed Northern journalists are cited by name and given Lincoln's permission to accompany and record Grant and his Hdqtrs most important decisions. They systematically and suddenly disappear, freely moving into Confederate lines to divulge the plans, watch the outcome, report the calamity they stoked to simply disappear back into that media establishment.

Grant was thoroughly familiar with the MSM of the times fake news and hoax playbook. The Confederacy never had a chance of victory, yet the media kept that silent. How the MSM narrative could be sold and believed in the North to nearly elect the do-nothing McClellan over Lincoln is a said chapter.

The Confederate government was rotten to its core. Confederate civilians were not free; they were looted, impressed male ages of 14 to 60 and the women used as thralls to maintain the hopeless war machine. Confederate state citizens were held in a state of violence as virtual prisoners. There was no Confederate 'Bill of Rights"". Grant takes the reader on that journey to illustrate precisely why. La visione della Storia che ci offrono i nostri studi e ancora di più il nostro provincialismo ci lascia all'oscuro di eventi importanti e decisivi, solo perché si sono verificati lontano dall'Europa o dall'Italia. La Guerra di Secessione americana, contemporanea della parte più decisiva del nostro Risorgimento, meriterebbe una maggiore attenzione da parte nostra. E' stata la più sanguinosa nella storia degli USA ed ha anticipato per molti versi le strategie e le tecniche di combattimento della I Guerra Mondiale. La figura di U.S. Grant emerge, fra i protagonisti di quel conflitto, come quella di uno stratega acuto, un genio militare e un uomo pragmatico e nello stesso tempo generoso e ironico. La sua autobiografia, scritta in un inglese elegante nella sua piana semplicità, ne mette in risalto le qualità, prima fra tutte la capacità di riconoscere i meriti dei suoi sottoposti (in particolare il generale Sherman) anche a costo di sminuire i propri. Ricca di aneddoti anche divertenti e spesso autoironici, non è mai autoalogiativa. Particolarmente significativo è il disprezzo che dichiara verso i generali che brigavano per ottenere incarichi e la sua ammirazione per quelli che gli incarichi se li meritavano sul campo. Il libro si legge come un romanzo ed è fra i pochi che, terminata la lettura, inducono a desiderare di rileggerli al più presto. Purchased the Kindle edition. Have read many various books on the American Civil War and having just read US Grant memoirs, one can appreciate the life that he had in those times. First hand recollection of the American civil war. It is (obviously!) written in the style of the time, which makes the reader ‘work’ a bit harder - but this also provides a real understanding of the thinking, and the values, of people who lived through the events. Ulysses Grant was an amazing person, so humble about his own skills and contribution to the Union - but also possessing the confidence and decisiveness sadly lacking in other generals. He was also that rare type of leader who is willing to listen to others, and to recognise their skills when proven on the battlefield. He comes across as a person of real integrity - which is 9n stark contrast to the political leadership in the US today....and how tragic, given the hardships endured, and the loss of life difficult of the civil war, which created the modern nation! on en a pour son argent. le prix faible est justifié par une impression sur du papier de photocopieuse de 60 ou 70gr grand max... mise en page inexistante: bordures bien trop grande à mon sens..
ca ressemble à un manuel. si votre intention est de le passer entierement au fluo alors n hesitez pas.
+ seul point positif notable:la converture est entierement vernis mat. (1eme/4eme/tranche) The book gives a unique view of the differences between the States and cultures that has a special relevance today when the States are again divided by cultural differences that seem very great with even the talk of another kind of civil war."
The Yellow Wallpaper (AmazonClassics Edition),"In a long-unoccupied mansion, a new mother is confined to what was once a nursery. She is assured by her physician husband that it is a necessary cure to ease her “nervous depression.” Isolated and powerless, she becomes obsessed with the peeling, sickly colored wallpaper. In it, she sees what no one else can: a prisoner desperate to escape its maddening design.
A condemnation of the patriarchy, The Yellow Wallpaper explores with terrifying economy the oppression, grave misunderstanding, and willful dismissal of women in late nineteenth-century society. I read this short story every time I come across it. And it gets better with each reading. The author skillfully and subtly weaves the main character's increasing break from reality with seemingly sane thoughts until suddenly you realize the main character has gone insane.

It is a delight to read. I would compare it to Shirley Jackson's stories, such as We Have Always Lived In the Castle. Charlotte Perkins Gilman was a leading female activist and voice in the woman’s movement in the early portions of the 20th century. “The Yellow Wallpaper” is her short work that depicts one woman’s fight against the “rest cure” she is ordered to follow to cure her depression.

“I thought it was a good time to talk, so I told him I was not gaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.”

Her husband, John, has secluded her in a room to help her condition and her nervousness at this situation has exacted a heavy toll on her psyche and mental well-being. As part of her narrative and describing her condition and descent into the brink of madness, she becomes obsessed and fixated on the yellow wall paper in the room she resides in. Various freedoms are stripped from her: she hides her writings from her husband because he forbids it. She unfolds all details to us as she stays in the room, and it is quite uncomfortable to see how her mental state begins to derail and shatter more and more as each hour and day passes.

One of the most chilling-- and effective-- aspects to this story is simply hearing everything from the woman’s point of view. We get hints of the true status of her and her husband’s relationship, and his lack of concern for her and well as the troubling and suffocating feeling of her mental state. This is a story that speaks strongly for those who have depression as well as making a statement for woman’s rights. Definitely a somber, unsettling story to read, but one that will make one think, and definitely encourage discussion about its major themes.

This story will make you feel uncomfortable and ill at ease as you read, and I’m sure that was what Gilman was intending. A very quick read right before bed. Based on reviews. I expected this to be a very scary read. I unfortunately craved it to be scarier once I finished it. Maybe my hopes were too high on the fright expectation. It's one of my first ""scary"" reads. I give it 3 stars for telling a story in a short read and piquing my interest to delve further into this genre of reading. Start with a nervous post partum wife. Add an ""I know better than you doctor husband and a horribly deteriorated room with ugly yellow wallpaper and you have the ingredients for a decent into madness. The progression starts gradually until you have no doubt she is mentally gone. Gives me chills every time. Even as a grad student in English I struggle with a good share of classic literature, but, of course, that's another discussion for another time. 'The Yellow Wallpaper,' on the other hand, is a rare gem that easily transcends time. Not only does this short tale entertain, it speaks of powerful and unfortunate truths.

This layered story is haunting in three ways: creepy wallpaper that moves and may very well be harboring paranormal entities; the trials and failures of medicine to treat mental illness, as well as the difficulties of being the victim of said treatments; the struggles of feminism. It is relevant, powerful, and poignant. A must read. Obviously this is full of symbolism and depicts a poor woman’s descent into madness. Classic quick read. Last time I read this was in my high school English class and had forgotten about it for some time. I do love this style of writing and recommend for anyone who enjoys reading. This is a beautifully agonizing short story that takes about a day to read. As so many others have already recapped the story I won't so the same here. The fluency of the author's style is graceful & her use of vocabulary creative and strong as her story flows from one page to another, sans chapters or breaks of any kind. In this the writing seems to be one thought, as the narrator's innermost thoughts compel her, moving like a Mack truck steadily gaining speed and heading toward an unavoidable cliff.

The narrator takes you by the hand, and as you follow her on her journey you pass many creepy, hallucinogenic visions of her world as it warps around her.

Personally, as a woman who finds herself looking primarily to men for ""doctoring"" who also enjoys an artistic outlet, it is a grim reminder to remain active in your own care and to remain connected with the others around you.

By the end you feel saddened at the depths of instability her trapped lonely existence has brought her to; and you morn what was obviously a gifted mind.

A very worthy read. The Yellow Wallpaper is a horrifying study of a woman slowly losing her mind as well as the obtuseness of her doctor husband in refusing to hear his wife and recognize the symptoms. As the narrator continues to slip deeper into paranoid delusions triggered by what is clearly postpartum depression, the result is an amazing ending that has kept this 19th century tale a horror classic. Muy sobrio y agradable para empezar a leer tascabile, comodo e molto bello da leggere. Arrivato nei tempi previsti e in ottime condizioni And the story is very interesting Las historias son entretenidas y te dejan queriendo leer más. Excellent short description of someone going mad. The anguish, the desperation to have freedom but feeling powerless about it can be felt as reader."
Robinson Crusoe (AmazonClassics Edition),"When mariner Robinson Crusoe sails from London to the African coast to Brazil, his unpredictable voyage takes a catastrophic course. The lone survivor of a shipwreck, he washes ashore on an Atlantic island. Resourceful and determined to contend with providence and nature, he finds his sovereignty empowering. Through the years he builds a civilization as a solitary man. Then he discovers a stranger’s footprint in the sand.
A pioneering work of literary realism, Daniel Defoe’s epic has left an inestimable legacy. Arguably the first English novel and the archetype of the survivalist genre, Robinson Crusoe has become a symbol of self-reliance and individualism.
Revised edition: Previously published as Robinson Crusoe, this edition of Robinson Crusoe (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I bought four other books the same time I bought this one, and I saved this one for last because I was the least excited about it. I thought it could potentially be similar to the book Treasure Island, which I found to be quite mediocre. But the price was right, so I figured I'd give it a shot.

And I'd have to say it was definitely well worth reading. But I'm not sure why I liked it so much. Perhaps it was the matter-of-fact writing style, that just kind of tells things the way they are without trying to add any additional suspense buzz-words to events wild enough to stand on their own. That method gives the fictional story more authenticity I think. Great example of showing, not telling. Plus there's a lot of slow build up to certain major events that's enough to keep you interested but not too slow that you forget about what's coming, or you just get tired of waiting. And the author's inclusion of mistakes like the issue with the canoe give it more realism also.

So I guess it was just the quality of the prose that drew me in. Great prose can make anything sound good. Even sitting on a deserted island for 20 plus years. And since a good chunk of this book happens in complete solitude, a book format is perfect because books tend to be better about showing what's going on in a character's mind than a movie would be. Written in old English speak,but gives an insight into the vocabulary used in the 17th.century. waiting for man Friday to arrive ! Over half way though the story, the periodic arrival of cannibals from the mainland to partake in the ritual, vis. killing and eating of their captured upon the beach, life for Crusoe becomes very unsettled. His existence changing from one of reluctant make do, and contented improvement to his lot, to one of fear, and great apprehension, should the aggressive savages learn of his existence. With the increasing number of visits to ""His"" island, Crusoe is bound by his conscience to take a closer look at these events, and is able to help the escape of one of the victims. Enter Man Friday, and we cut to the chase as the story picks up pace, Crusoe now having a companion, all` be it a savage, is able to teach him the skills of civilized man, including a fairly heavy indoctrination of Christianity, to which a reader to day can only be made aware of the power of the church over an author of that period if he would get his works into print. After another rescue of several victims from the cannibals, the number of castaways on the Island has grown requiring more food production. Eventually a scheme is devised to build a large vessel, and rescue a large group of ship wrecked sailors from the mainland living a wretched existence among the Natives .... The plot thickens. Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe is a book I’d read excerpts from, even extensive ones, but I’d just never read the whole book before. To say the least, I was surprised!

For one, I was surprised how easy it is to read. It would be great for young men, probably junior high age or high school. It has all the elements that would interest young people. The story begins with a rebellious boy who signs up against his parents’ wishes to sail the seas. He reaps the consequences of his sinfulness and becomes even more rebellious. As God would have it, He teaches Robinson a huge lesson about His grace by allowing him to be the sole survivor of a shipwreck.

It’s told in first person and describes how Robinson not only survives, but thrives. He does ingenious things in order to shelter, clothe, and feed himself. He builds an amazing fortress that no one would ever guess was there—even while looking straight at it. And, he finds forgiveness and a very strong Christian faith with a dependence on and love for the Bible.

After over twenty years alone on the island, Robinson discovers a single footprint. Later, he watches cannibals. He also ends up saving a man from being eaten. This man becomes his lifelong servant, Friday. Robinson leads him to Christ and he teaches him how to survive on the island.

Robinson and Friday have some fights and adventures, eventually leaving the island and going back to England.

This is an exciting book, well told. It is strong in its teaching about grace, mercy, and salvation.

The elements you might want to discuss with your children are: the use of tobacco and liquors, cannibalism, Robinson's making Friday a servant by saving his life, and killing in self-defense. I believe these are all good discussions that will add to positive parenting.

I personally loved Robinson Crusoe and would recommend it to boys especially, but also to many girls. It’s a great old classic and an amazingly forward-thinking book for having been written in 1719. No wonder it’s been translated into many languages and read the world over! Um bom livro. Ansioso pra ler It seemed like the writing was emotionless.

Considering the time it was written, I was expecting richer language.

Short and sweet. Good as always in this collection. There is absolutely no doubt that this is one of the most influential English novels of all times. Not only newer versions of ""Robinson Crusoe"" were written in great numbers and changed the original slightly, but even some other major novels like ""Lord of the Flies"" seem to base to a large extent on Defoe's masterpiece. That also goes for movies like ""Castaway"" with Tom Hanks, although in alters the original immersively.

The reading - although re-edited and transfered into modern English - is mostly fluent and straightforward. Some words seem to have a completely changend meaning nowadays and for me as a non-native speaker of English, I confess I sometimes had my difficulties with some words.
If the story would be written in the 21st century, the author would probably shorten it a little bit, since some passages are somewhat tedious to read and too detailed for the modern reader. This on my account applies for the middle part of the narrative that could be more suspensful because it seems to lose the thread bit and bit. And it also goes for the main characters repetitive adressing of god and fate all the time (it's a book written three hundred years ago, so this was quite common).

Nevertheless, I did not dare to cut a star for the ""weaker"" middle part of the story since this truly is a English classic and should be read if you are interested in major works of the English language. It is really interesting how modern versions of this narrative changend central points, especially the editions for children did a lot alteration with the character ""Friday"" who does not really have a clay feet in the original.
Having another theme, but also taking place on a deserted island is ""Lord of the Flies"" from William Golding. This also could be a good reading for you, if you like Defoe's setting here, but it's much more modern in style since written in 1951. Read this book in my school library and got a chance to read it again after 8+ years.

VERY GOOD STORY. YOU WILL DEFINATELY FIND IT INTERESTING."
Othello (AmazonClassics Edition),"As war rages between Venice and Turkey, Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army, is determined to lead his men to victory with his trusted ensign, Iago. But, after being passed up for a promotion, Iago has plans of his own. Using the general’s wife, Desdemona, as a pawn, Iago spins an elaborate web of deception. Once he has Othello where he wants him, revenge will be his.
One of Shakespeare’s most performed tragedies, Othello’s themes of racism, revenge, and betrayal continue to resonate, as does its most tantalizing and arguable question: What makes Iago so unconscionably evil?
Revised edition: Previously published as Othello, this edition of Othello (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Othello, or The Tradegy of Othello, the Moor of Venice, is a tragic play written by the illustrious William Shakespeare, who also wrote many more plays throughout his lifetime and is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language. The first edition was written in approximately 1603, and the story is based upon a short Italian story called ""Un Capitano Toro,"" or ""The Moorish Captain."" There have been many editions printed and to this day Othello is still performed in professional and communities today. It's impossible to shake the popularity of Shakespeare's works, if not all, as Othello has spawned numerous movie, opera, and book versions. The edition that I am reviewing is the electronic Kindle version, published by Public Domain Books, with 182 pages and in playwright form.
Set in the beautiful city of Venice and the country of Cyprus, the story takes place in about the late 1500s, and the early 1600s. Othello, a courageous and skilled soldier, is married to the lovely Desdemona, with whom he is quite taken with. Though Othello has everything going for him there is one person who, unbeknownst to him, threatens to destroy that happiness. That person is Iago, Othello's appointed ensign. Hidden under a veil of honesty, Othello puts bestows great trust on Iago, though the latter is, in reality, a cruel and despicable man who will do anything to get what he desires. Including characters that simply add more thrilling drama and shocking intrigue, the play beautifully and darkly illustrates Othello's descent into madness, and leads up to the stunning conclusion that truly makes this a ""tragedy.""
After Othello secretly elopes with Desdemona, a wealthy man named Roderigo who is upset at this arrangement complains to Iago, a soldier that serves under Othello. Iago and Roderigo share the shame ire towards the former but for different reasons. After having promoted the younger and less-experienced Cassio to lieutenant over himself, Iago plots to manipulate Othello into thinking that his wife is cheating on him. Iago proceeds to use his guile to toy with Othello's mind, shattering the trust he felt towards Desdemona, and morphing him into a vessel filled with rage, doubt, jealousy. Effectively, he utilizes Cassio and even his own wife to spite Othello. In a rage of grief and jealousy, Othello chooses to believe Iago's words, and more than one person has fallen to his serpent's tongue.
Othello demonstrates the importance of trust. For example, Othello trusted Iago, and was therefore easily swayed by his words. His trust for Desdemona shatters with each moment of evidence that arises in favor of Desdemona cheating on him with Cassio. Another theme is believing what your eyes see versus reality. The force of Iago's manipulations made a greater force on Othello, rendering him paranoid and green with envy. Despite her husband's odd behavior towards her, Desdemona does nothing more than try to reinforce her love for him, despite his harsh words. Because of that love, she still has faith in him. Sadly, that faith doesn't pull through in the end...
This play was nothing short of impressive. Beautifully written, nothing less from the great Shakespeare, it is a read that teens will find exciting, despite the year it was written. Though Othello is the title character, the one who shined the most to me was definitely Iago. He is the epitome of cruelty and manipulation, the kind of person that everyone loves to hate. Desdemona's love for Othello despite his mistrust of her was touching, and the ending left me deeply saddened, but had me cheering for its brilliance. This book is simply another gem from William Shakespeare and, dare I say it, possibly one of his best. A classic and a great tragedy and characters The Folger Shakespeare Library edition provides an excellent introduction to the play, making it accessible to both newcomers and experienced readers of Shakespeare. The introduction and annotations are informative and enhance the understanding of the text, especially for those not familiar with the language of the Elizabethan era.

The character of Othello is masterfully portrayed, and his descent into jealousy and madness is both heartbreaking and thought-provoking. Iago's cunning manipulation is brilliantly depicted, leaving you questioning the depths to which human jealousy can drive a person.

The themes explored in ""Othello"" are as relevant today as they were in Shakespeare's time, making this play a timeless exploration of human nature and the destructive power of jealousy and mistrust.

Whether you're a Shakespeare aficionado or just looking for a compelling read, ""Othello (Folger Shakespeare Library)"" is a must-have addition to your library. It's a powerful work of literature that will leave a lasting impression and provide plenty of material for reflection and discussion.

In conclusion, I highly recommend this edition of ""Othello"" to anyone who appreciates classic literature, intricate character development, and profound themes. It's a brilliant and enduring masterpiece that continues to resonate with readers of all generations. it was fine just very small Having read a number of Shakespeare tragedies while in high school, I was well aware that in any of them a whole bunch of people are going to die . I'm not quite sure how but I had somehow missed Othello in my Shakespeare reading days, but of course one usually has an idea of what it is about even without reading it.

So the question remains, if I knew what it was about and how it was going to end, why should I bother to read it? Would the experience, be worth the effort expended, I wondered and finally after four decades, I decided that it would indeed. While knowing that Othello will be convinced by the evil Iago to kill his faithful wife, Desdemona, the experience of reading Othello is enjoyable for its lush language, and very human story.

Iago is perhaps king of evil manipulators. We've all met some, I think and hopefully the experience has taught us to be cautious of those with a silken tongue, but poor Othello, although a general, is a bit of a gullible fool. The reader watches in awe as Iago weaves his web around Othello, to bring about his downfall. Warning Othello of the nature of jealousy, in an effort to further fan the flames Iago says:

""O, beware, my lord, of jealousy!
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
The meat it feeds on.""

To tempt Cassio into drinking more Iago replies:

""Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used.""

After reading Othello, I believe it was well worth it and would encourage others to do so as well. Very hard to follow - script not printed in an accessible way, font is aesthetically unappealing. Othello é um grande clássico da literatura, é uma bela obra shakespeariana. É uma obra atemporal! todo perfecto very helpful for vce english Reading Othello was significant for me in a special way. back in the 50s and I suppose for a time after that, supermarkets used to offer special collections of books at the rate of one book per week. They also did with dinnerware, cutlery etc. They would off individual volumes of encyclopedias etc. at very low prices to attract repeat customers. This was like the weekly serials that used to play in movie theatres. I remember my mother buying a hardbound copy of Othello in one of these offers from, I’m almost certain, Loblaws. The volume lay around out house for quite awhile. I tried to read it a few times but the language flummoxed me. I didn’t know what ‘Exeunt’ meant etc. However, the play did make an impression on my and I remembered the name ‘Iago’ all through my childhood. I became aware of the rudiments of the play over the years. I knew that Iago convinced Othello that his wife was unfaithful. However, I always thought that Othello strangled Desdemona rather than smothering her.

That book that my mother bought was at the beginning of my life. Now in my 70 with my mortality becoming very real to me, I have embarked on a project to read all of the literature that I was assigned to read in school but didn’t. I’ve read all of the Shakespeare plays that I was assigned in high school and now am trying to read as many of the plays as possible in their Folger editions. I was looking forward to Othello coming up in this process because I would be able to read the book that I tried to read in my childhood over 60 years ago. I’m’ very glad that I did.
I can’t match the scholarship that is available on this play However, I think that there is a way to view the play that is quite relevant to today’s world. The issue of social media and how it can be used by malefactors to seed discord and hatred is something that can be applied to the play. Iago preys upon people in much the same way that social media malefactors do. He does not try to convince people of something that they re already not predisposed to believe. He just supplies a slight nudge in much the same way advocates uses ‘nudges’ in public service advertising. He then just assists these people with continuing nudges to follow their own path to the conclusions to which they are prone. Thus, he is able to convince Othello and Rodrigo of supposed facts about that Desdemona that bear no basis in reality but fit their preconceptions.

Othello was written over 400 years ago, but it is highly relevant of today. Social media is but a new venue for Iago-like malefactors to operate. It can make their activity more efficient but as Othello shows their tactics have been sued for centuries and likely millennia."

Since their publication, Shakespeare’s poems have served as touchstones, providing readers from all walks of life with the opportunity to articulate the inscrutable feelings of the heart.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Shakespeare's Sonnets, this edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Since reviews for various editions of Shakespeare's sonnets are lumped together on Amazon, I'll begin by saying that I am reviewing Shakespeare's Sonnets (Folger Shakespeare Library) published on Aug.16, 2016, and selling today for $4.99, and I am reading it on my Kindle Keyboard. I am very, very pleased with this version! All the links work well, the font is clear and attractive, and the formatting is just fine.

When you go to the Table of Contents, you will see that the edition begins with the following commentary: the Editor's Preface; Shakespeare's Sonnets; Reading Shakespeare's Language: The Sonnets; Shakespeare's Life; An Introduction to the Text.

Then you will see the sonnets themselves: Text of the Poems With Commentary. Each sonnet can be accessed individually by an active link, and each has links throughout the text with annotations. I like being able to just click on a phrase or word as I am reading in order to access extremely helpful commentary.

After the individual sonnets, you will see the following listed: Two Sonnets from The Passionate Pilgrim; Longer Notes; Textual Notes; Appendix of Intertextual Material; Shakespeare's Sonnets: A Modern Perspective by Lynne Magnusson; Further Reading; Index of Illustrations (there are many, and each has an active link which will take you to it); Index of First Lines.

I looked at many versions on Amazon before making my selection. True, there are others which cost just one or two dollars, but they lack access to each individual sonnet and/or textual annotations. They don't have all the other interesting material included here. If you want to read the sonnets on your Kindle, you really can't do better than The Folger Shakespeare. Shakespeare's collection of sonnets is so much a part of the western cultural heritage that reviewing it is kind of like taking coals to Newcastle, but it is worth a few words. First, however, a note about this edition: it is exactly what I wanted, with a few unobstructive footnotes at the bottom of each page, an index of first lines, and two critical introductions, one offering up historical context, the other more interpretative. They enhance your reading, they do not do it for you.

Now, why you want to read this collection. Most of us come to the sonnets singly: random reading assignments, in mixed anthologies, or one is quoted provocatively some place. With few exceptions, each is a perfect example of what the sonnet form does and how form itself shapes meaning. But read straight through consecutively, they offer a close-to-the-bone narrative of Shakespeare's preoccupations. This is the source of all that speculation about his sexual preferences. We've all heard lots of opinions on the bard's relationship with the ""Young Man"" and the ""Dark Lady"" but there is nothing like getting it first hand, and I must say that my ideas changed after sorting through for myself. For one thing, love--platonic or carnal--is not the only thing on his mind. Immortality, beauty, truth and a few other problems get a work out. The most pleasant surprise is how truly readable and accessible it all is. The book remains unquestionably the best poems that trancend all that is known about the heart's expression of love regardless of your universe and degrees of fidelity period Poetry is not much my cup of tea, I gave this book a try because Shakespeare work is astonishing. His work makes our reality richer than the worlds imagined in previous and posterior mythology. I started the book thinking it at first just poems about love, but there is a story, with deep observations and intense feelings. They make you feel, without filters, love as if you yourself were feeling it. You can open a Shakespeare book not knowing what to expect but it ends being spectacular.

About the AmazonClassics edition you cannot find better ones for books written in English and without drawings. They have the useful X-Ray, impeccable formatting, modern typography and clean of misspellings. Other advantage is that it has not studies by intellectuals, prefaces nor introductions, only a biography of few words at the end about the author. The book is as pure as if it had been written this morning; the only defect is the reader, as I have not enough knowledge of poetry to notice, beyond evident rhyme and alliteration, the poetic structure donned by Shakespeare. Katherine Duncan-Jones in the Arden Shakespeare's Sonnets is closer to Stephen Booth's linguistic approach from Helen Vendler,s artistic analysis of the Sonnets. I think she made a mature choice because Old Will in his love lyrics is ambigous and misleading.His words are loaded with meanings and accordingly are open to more than one interpretation.Publishing the detailed notes and commentry on the same page looks more practical and helpful, not only for the students but also for the general reader.Nevertheless, Hank Wittemore's version of Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, recently published for the first time , emphasizes that the dedicatee of Shakespeare,s Sonnets is Henry Wriothesley, Third Earl of Southampton and not William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke as the Arden,s editor of the Sonnets suggests in her introduction. Since 400 years the dedicatee,s identity had been masked. A.L. Rowse in 1964 published his version of the Sonnets and held that Shakespeare dedicated his poems to his close friend and patron Earl of Southampton. Now Wriothesley proved what Rowse had cocluded in his literary and historical researching half a century ago.
In the next edition of the Arden,s Sonnets I hope Katherine Duncan-Jones sheds more illuminating light on this issue which puzzled many Shakespearians for a very long time.

Duke University je l'ai acheté pour ma fille, elle est ravie, le livre est super intéressant d'après ce que ma fille m'a dit, et elle adore l'anglais, elle est d'ailleurs la première de sa classe, et pratique l'anglais comme sa langue maternelle, soit, merveilleusement bien, elle ne regarde presque jamais les films en français, ne lit pratiquement que les livres anglais, sauf ceux qu'elle doit lire pour ses cours; à part cela rien de particulier sur cet achat, AMAZON hyper rapide, le bonheur AMAZON This is clearly a milestone-work of scholarship on the sonnets and has duly taken its place among the most referenced works. The Renaissance context is painstakingly identified for the modern reader and the critical analysis of language is remarkable.
Booth’s incredible research means he is able to explore semantic and syntactic possibilities as he explores interpretations of the sonnets.
I’ve spent the last few weeks in the summer sunshine reading the sonnets in the editions of Booth, Helen Vendler and Don Paterson. I read a sonnet and see what I can work out for myself. I then look to Paterson for a reader-poet’s fresh, funny, perceptive take on the poem. He’s brilliant when dispensing with cultural reverence and calling it as he sees and feels it. Then I turn to Booth for a guide to language in its historical context. Readings come into sharper focus and make greater sense when he connects language with proverb, scripture, the demotic etc. He anatomises the possibilities of grammatical form and meaning such that the reader is able try out the suggestions. Finally, Vendler brings an amazing perceptiveness to the form and structure of poetic language. Her insights are like revelations as she present gifts of seeing to her readers.
Sometimes I change the order of reading just to see what happens. It’s like setting up a debate with the three commentaries. They argue with each other and I listen in.
The whole experience has been more exciting than reading a thriller, more enlightening than any lecture. 本ソネットの主人公の一人ダーク・レディはシェイクスピアの恋人で、色黒、不美人、淫らな女性が通説。読んでいて私は全く逆の女性像が浮かびました。シェイクスピアの心を捉えるには知性と会話力が必要ですし、貴族のレディ（貴婦人）なら美人でしょう。さらに彼を虜にする官能美（lusty）が必要です。具体的にどんな女性かと思い巡らしたら、いました膳場貴子さんです。東京の名家出身で東大医学部卒、知性・家柄は十分、アナウンサーなので会話も上手で美人、学生時代のバイトはグラドルとかで魅力満載。離婚歴2回がダークつまり陰です。

閑話休題：全く偶然、何も知らずに北白川学園のソネット講座を受講。シェイクスピア大先生なので高尚な詩集かと思いきや、全くの逆。フェア・ユースと言う青年との同性愛とダーク・レデイとの不倫、そして著者：シェイクスピアを含めた３者の複雑な三角関係、「何だこれ？」と驚きました。著者のゲイ好みや、不倫相手への愛憎など聞きたくもないと思ってたのですが、そのうちにソネット（14行詩）に秘められた時に細やか時に大胆な愛憎表現。韻を踏んだリズミカルな朗読、理解を読み手に託した内容の広さと深さ、私みたいなな初心者でも良さが分ってきます。手に取り紐解くのも一趣です。 Tô gostando muito. Recomendo ter um bom dicionário em mãos. I sonetti di Shakespeare costituiscono una magnifica opera poetica, li conoscevo già avendoli letti più volte in italiano ma ritengo che la fruizione in inglese abbia un fascino proprio difficilmente riproducibile."
The Idiot (AmazonClassics Edition),"After being treated for epilepsy at a Swiss sanatorium, Prince Muishkin returns to St. Petersburg to reconnect with a wealthy distant relative and her family. Guileless and charming, Muishkin endears himself to everyone he meets, and they place him in the center of high society’s conflicts. Soon Muishkin becomes caught in a sphere of jealousy, betrayal, extortion, and murder. And he finds his loyalties divided between two women—one needing love, the other salvation.
Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s most personal work, The Idiot is an uncompromising look at a corrupt world where moral men and women are sometimes limited to immoral choices.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Idiot, this edition of The Idiot (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This is the second Dostoevsky novel I've read, and while the tone is very different than that of Crime and Punishment, The Idiot is every bit as moving and memorable. As I said in my review for Crime and Punishment, the reader must work a little harder to engage Dostoevsky's style, but the effort pays off immensely. I've developed my own method for reading this author's works, an approach to comprehending his characters and their mindsets that I don't employ when digesting other works of fiction. I read and re-read passages, and often I'll pause to interpret dialog as it might have been written today. I'll find myself reflecting on particular developments of the story and patiently dwell on them. While I quickly devour most books I read and the subsequent level of enjoyment I achieve is satisfactory, Dostoevsky requires that I take my time and feast on the richness of the relationships he created. Hopefully, this makes sense to anyone reading this review; I don't feel like I've explained myself particularly well...

Anyway, the story itself revolves around a noble, beautiful character with a history of health issues and a frail constitution. Physically, mentally, and emotionally, Prince Lef Muishkin just doesn't fit into a society consumed with greed, selfish pursuits, social prejudice, sexual conquests, and self-destructive behavior. Many of the other characters in the novel are black-hearted, money-grubbing, control freaks, but Muishkin is hopeful and supremely optimistic by nature. He's occasionally prone to worries and fears, but generally, he's unusually happy with his lot in life, whatever it is.

Prince Muishkin's simplicity is often mistaken for stupidity by people who think him inferior and foolish because he doesn't value temporal ""treasures"". In spite of his outward appearance and the first impression he often makes, the prince always changes the hearts of his doubters and wins them over to think of him as an extraordinary person with an extraordinary perspective on life. Usually his detractors continue to think he's a bit strange, but they grow to love and respect him. He has an unusual power over people.

Our hero has adventures and grows tremendously as a person through his trials, but there's no happy ending. Ultimately, he's defeated by the obsessive depravity he's surrounded by. Sadly, he's reverted to his previous state of emotional despair, and one event completes his descent into catatonia.

If you're a patient reader and willing to invest in a story that takes some work, The Idiot will stir you. It's memorable and moving. I can't wait read more by Dostoevsky. Now it's on to The Brothers Karamazov. It needs to be stated at the outset that this is not a novel about politics and the social interactions they inspire as Dostoyevsky is known for in his other novels. This novel focuses mainly on the social interactions and how newcomers must conform or fail immediately. If you have read Crime and Punishment or The Brothers Karamazov you might readily expect political intrigue to be the main barrier our ""hero"" faces but instead this plays out more like a soap opera. If you are familiar with Tolstoy's War and Peace this novel will seem quite familiar in form but if not it is still worth a look.

The reason I stress the difference between political intrigue and social norms as primary movers of events though the two are quite related is because the former is heavily reliant on place, time, and the social hierarchy of interrelated characters it is almost irrelevant in the latter. Without giving too much of the plot away let me end by saying that while this does not approach the level of an epic tragedy we can see the windup of the novel from the outset and only a wit and writing style like Dostoyevsky's can make such a story interesting from beginning to end.

With that said and to wrap up the novel was very good but not great. Had the nove another 600 pages like war and peace we might have had more development and intrigue but a character like our hero was not built for such and as a result his flaws will make you want to tear your eyes out at times or thst of some supporting characters like hippolyte. I could definitely read this again but knowing the ending (though it was apparent from th beginning) for sure would make the novel less enjoyable. This review is not written from the point of view of a literary genius or as a critique of the translation. It is intended as a review for the rest of us -- the ordinary man or woman.

This book is very long, as are most of Dostoevsky's works, depending on the formatting and font, from 600 to 800 pages.

The story is sweet, very touching and very sad, leaving one with an empty feeling and a sense of shame for the entire human race. The prince, the main character, suffers from epilepsy. Unfortunately, at that time, the disease was little understood. This resulted in most people regarding him as an idiot, a name they openly called him to his face. But the prince, although shy and gentle, is far from stupid. He endures much abuse and is often misunderstood, but remains a good, generous, honorable man. He comes to care for two women -- one because he feels sorry for her, and one because he loves her. Both of them are sometimes nice and sometimes cruel to him.

The story is told from the third person perspective, as if a storyteller were relating it to the reader. The author goes into great detail regarding the appearance, background and thoughts of all characters, even those of a minor nature. This causes the book to be a long read, which I think most contemporary readers will find tedious. Additionally, the Russian names, and each character has at least two, are confusing. Dostoevsky is considered one of the greatest writers of all time, so I would never take it upon myself to criticize his work, and in fact, I did like the book and would recommend it, but for serious readers only. If you're looking for light entertainment, this will not be your cup of tea. Honestly, I have skipped some pages to finish the story. But trust me it's an excellent book. Just stay with the author and be patient I first read this when I was 17. I'm 75 and have just finished it for the ? 5th time. The end is as great a shock as it ever was. For me it's THE book and Myshkin a truly unforgettable character along with 4 or 5 others that stay in the mind forever. Read it. I have started reading this book as I loved Crime and Punishment and remembered a librarian telling me that she like Idiot better. I was working in this place where I would have a lot of free time and so wanted to read some short stories but came across this loooong novel and decided to give it ago. Well, it was okay. I found it a bit repetitive and unbelievable (how can they still call Prince an idiot 500 pages into the book?!). I was waiting for something big to happen for so long and it did but in the very end only! Definitely a good read, however this translation differs slightly to the one made by Penguin Classics... even so, a very good read, I would recommend it if you're looking for something to read while traveling. I particularly liked the assertion that 55 years is the perfect time to enjoy life. I love the chariot Prince M as he is a good, Christian soul surviving in a cynical world that claims to be Christian but isn't. I am a Christian existentialist like Dostoyevsky and I feel this burden too.."
The Call of the Wild (AmazonClassics Edition),"In this classic American adventure, Jack London explores the laws of civilization and wilderness—and the pull of instinct—through the eyes of Buck, a half Saint Bernard, half Scottish shepherd. Stolen from his comfortable life in California, Buck is sold into service as a sled dog during the Klondike Gold Rush, where returning to his primordial nature is the only way for him to survive.
London drew on his own experiences as a prospector in the Canadian wilderness, as well as the philosophies of Charles Darwin and Friedrich Nietzsche, for this enduring tale of survival.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Call of the Wild, this edition of The Call of the Wild (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. The Call of the Wild by Jack London is better today than it was when I was younger. I’ve read it several times over the years but this is the first time listening to an audio of it. I listened to the version narrated by Roger Dressler and quite enjoyed it, as I listened in one sitting. One of the things I love about this story is that our narrator in the story is Buck, a Saint Bernard/shepard mix, I believe it gives us a unique perspective and insight into his world that we otherwise wouldn’t see if the story was told from a human perspective. I would recommend this as it is a classic however, just know there is animal cruelty. 90 year old mother in law wanted to re read this book so we found this large print version. Very nice. Very nice indeed. for those who have not read The Call of the Wild before, be prepared ... it's not a modern book, and it has some violence, but it is a classic. I'll never forget it. I may just reread this large print copy myself. Amazon classic read as an audiobook offered in KU.
Great to read again. Curious about books with a POV when the main character is an animal.

Was this to soften the critique of how animalistic mankind can be? I read this book as a child when it was suggested to me by not only my family, but by my school. I’m not certain how old I was, but I’m certain that I wasn’t out of grade school. Of course, this was a different time when we found different priorities and I suppose my reading level was more important than my not finding the book I was reading to be full of sadness. Doesn’t most children love dogs and find animal abuse horrifying? I know that I certainly did, but once you start a book like this there’s no quitting it. So anyone who has not read this book and thinks it’s a good adventure book to give to a small child, I suggest you read it first. I was a tough kid, it was okay, just not what I expected as a child hoping for adventure.

It is a good book though, good enough for me to want to put it in my reviews and even skim it again. The story is set during the Klondike gold rush when a big and beautiful pet is stolen from a ranch in California to be used as a sled dog.

Buck’s life changes overnight from being pampered to being beaten by humans and bullied by other dogs. The temperature drops practically overnight, and Buck must learn to adapt to living in freezing conditions and snow with no shelter and very little food. He learns the pecking order fast, and learns that he doesn’t want to be submissive.

When they reach their destination the dogs are starved and further abused, but Buck is fortunate and is saved by a kind man that he forms a new bond with. That was one of my favorite parts of the book.

This is still a classic and good for young adults, but not for children imo. This is a beautiful edition of Jack London's classic book. The illustrations are fantastic, the fonts are perfect, and the paper is not thin. All in all, I love this collection. It is an excellent option for a birthday gift. I really enjoyed this audiobook. The narrator's delivery was easy to listen to, and he seemed to get into the story quite nicely. Now for the review: Jack London takes his Alaskan gold mining experience to create an awesome tale.

Buck belonged to a judge in California, in the days of the Klondike gold rush in Alaska. Buck was a large dog, half St. Bernard and half German Shepherd. he was not one of the judge's ""kennel dogs,"" nor was he one of the ""house dogs."" He walked with his master when he was outside, and hunted with the judge's sons. Buck was the king of his outside domain, but even though the judge treated him well, he did not know love.

One day the judge's Chinese cook ran up a gambling debt, and when no one was looking, he took Buck to town on a rope leash and sold him to a Klondike sled dog broker. It was then Buck learned the law of the club and fang. To get Buck into submission, the broker beat him mercilessly with a club. Buck was later sold and took to Alaska to start the menial and hard life of a sled dog.

London's writings are powerful and insightful. Buck goes from pet to work dog, from a life of relative ease to one of the harsh reaities of survival in one of the harshest environments of the world. Buck toughens up and survives, and rises to the top of the sled dog pack. Through a series of jobs where the dogs are nearly used up and destroyed, Buck is nearly killed by a family of idiots who buy them. He is saved by a man who shows him true love. Once his new master is lilled by Indians, Buck is free to join a wolf pack and becomes its leader. From beginning to end, this shows of survival of the fittest and the call of the wild on all dogs.

For and animal lover like myself, there were many times where I was cringing at the treatment of the animals. Buck triumphs over harsh treatment, harsh weather, lack of food, and other dogs that would kill him.

The call of the wild is a phrase that is part of American language even today. Great book. A tale or a remembrance of what we once were and perhaps still are. That's one thing we'll never really figure out. Sehr gut geschrieben und mit super Wortschatz.
Vorsicht wer gerade mit Englisch anfängt oder nur teilweise Englisch kann sollte sich ein Lexikon dazu bestellen.
Aber es lohnt sich dieses Buch zu Lesen entweder auf Englisch oder auf Deutsch. I read the book and watched the film (with Harrison Ford). The film was lovely actually seeing Buck (the dog). But the story was far better and went into much more detail, explaining things which perhaps couldn't be shown on the film. I really enjoyed this book. 👍👍👍 4 stars. The first time I read this book, I quite enjoyed it. It’s not for everyone. It's blunt and wild and violent and intense and alive. There were parts where even I cringed—particularly at the beginning. But somehow one grows hardened quickly, along with the dogs and the men… yet you never grow callous, only stronger.

The merit of this book is fascinating—real life in the Canadian Northwest in the 1890s, so often romanticized although anything but. It’s a story of sled dogs and mail couriers, with all their unvarnished coolness and strength. It is the tale of a dog stolen from a good home and becoming more and more brutalized until he joins his untamed brethren in the wilderness and forgoes civilization entirely.

The writing style of this book is really quite striking. Jack London brings to stark life the cold, cruel North. Although I live relatively to the South—relatively to Buck and his friends, that is—I have enough of a daily experience with the Canadian winter to recognize how accurately London writes. Besides good description, he has an excellent trick of saying much in few words, and giving much action without great detail. He makes a splendid study in brevity and clarity.

The characters of the book pass in and out like their shadows did through Buck’s life. François and Perrault won respect, if not affection, by their humanity and justness. They were a product of their surroundings—coarse, hard, simple men—but they were fair, and they treated their dogs with the humaneness they could afford. Charles, Mercedes, and Henry form a brief and tragic chapter; and then John brings a flow of real love that melts book’s iciness slightly.

The book is rather short—about a hundred pages, a novella’s size—but the story feels much longer, so much is compacted within those few 32,000 words. There is the warm beginning, a startling inciting event, then all of Buck’s education under Perrault as he runs the mail course up North; the return down South, worn to threadpaper; the terrible, crazy journey to the goldmines; the call of the wild… and the bittersweet ending. All along, London balances humour and grit, beauty and pain.

The theme of the book seems to be the puniness of mankind pitted against the grandeur of God’s creation, and it is strongly borne out to the reader. Man’s inability to control his own or his possessions’ life is deeply underlined. It is not, contrary to what London insists, blind chance or an impersonal train of events. But he shows the fragility of civilization against wilderness, of humanity against nature, in a way that drives home the folly of our own pride and self-sufficiency. The laws of creation are there, and man will never, can never, override them—they are set unchangingly by the Creator. This is one of the books that, depending on your worldview, changes dramatically. London’s own is evolutionary; and with that mindset, life is indeed drear and terrifying. With a God-centered perceptive, though, one finds comfort and security. A smaller message is the difference between caving to surroundings and becoming as harsh as they, as opposed to retaining one’s moral and civil code.

Content: violence; mild language.

A Favourite Quote: There is an ecstasy that marks the summit of life, and beyond which life cannot rise. And such is the paradox of living, this ecstasy comes when one is most alive, and it comes as a complete forgetfulness that one is alive. This ecstasy, this forgetfulness of living, comes to the artist, caught up and out of himself in a sheet of flame; it comes to the soldier, war-mad on a stricken field and refusing quarter; and it came to Buck, leading the pack, sounding the old wolf-cry, straining after the food that was alive and that fled swiftly before him through the moonlight.... He was mastered by the sheer surging of life, the tidal wave of being, the perfect joy of each separate muscle, joint, and sinew in that it was everything that was not death, that it was aglow and rampant, expressing itself in movement, flying exultantly under the stars and over the face of dead matter that did not move."
Andersen's Fairy Tales (AmazonClassics Edition),"Uniting universal themes with a wonderfully personal vision of the world, Hans Christian Andersen found magic in the landscape of childhood. His talking animals and living toys shine a sparkling light on the strange wisdom of innocence and the deceptive nature of adulthood. These stories have now been adapted into countless classic films (including The Little Mermaid, The Red Shoes, and Frozen—which was based on “The Snow Queen”) and have become part of our everyday speech, such as when we talk about “ugly ducklings” and “the emperor’s new clothes.”
Transcending generations, language, and nationality, these stories continue to delight and enlighten us in equal measure.
Revised edition: Previously published as Andersen's Fairy Tales, this edition of Andersen's Fairy Tales (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. These tales were the friends of my childhood (many, many years ago) reread again and again and again, and it is very good to revisit them. Their frequently strong and obvious moral content did not put me off. On the contrary, it had the desired effect of increasing my desire to be a better person. Some of the saddest tales made me cry, but I still loved them. And the sad endings prepared me for the fact that, in real life, there are also sad endings. Their originality is captivating. Certain images have stayed with me through the decades. The sanitized, fluffy, happy ending Disney versions have removed the heart of these stories. If you have no faith, you will not like these tales. If you don't like stories with obvious moral content, you will not like these tales. If you believe that children should be coddled and protected from any of the darker aspects of life, you should stick to the Disney versions. But you will be denying yourself a world of wonder and beauty, a world with a heart and a soul, a world with images that remain pertinent to this day. I believe that every child should hear at least some of them. Twenty classic fairy tales.

THE LITTLE MERMAID I had a mix bag of emotions/feelings toward this. Since my childhood days I'd heard about Hans Christian Andersen, but not until now did I read anything from him, including his famous Emperor's New Clothes, which is included in this compilation.

Aside from The Little Mermaid, the last fairy tale in the book, The Emperor's New Clothes is the story that stood out the most for me. It was the one I enjoyed the most.

If there is any short story in which an author so adeptly illustrated how shallow and pretentious people could be for the sake of appearing in what they imagine will be a favorable light in their peers' eyes, I'd love to read it.

Any author would be hard pressed to match or beat The Emperor for poignance and humor. Yes, the story is that good. It is a barrel of laughs while shedding light on a side of human nature that's not funny at all.

What's also not funny is the general tone of these fairy tales. I always thought and had the impression that Anderson's work would have a light hearted feel to them. I delved into the book expecting this, but was surprised to find these stories have a dark undertone. Very dark in some cases.

The Red Shoes and The Little Mermaid are cases in point. In the former, both of a little girl's lower legs were cut off. I felt horrified reading this, and it was not the first story here that left me feeling that way. Again, I believe this was made all the more poignant because this kind of stuff was just about the last thing I was expecting I'd find.

I didn't care for most of the fairy tales. I didn't find them engaging, so I forced myself to get through the middle of the book. For me it felt like a grind. Then, when I was nearing the end, I found the last two tales, The Red Shoes, and The Little Mermaid, to be much more engaging, albeit, as I said before, they have really dark undertones.

The latter of the two more so, which left me feeling flabbergasted because that story, much more so than even The Emperor's New Clothes, grabbed my attention and had me totally immersed. Totally vested the mermaid's fate.

I won't go into any plot details because I don't want to provide any spoilers. I'll only say this much. If you're expecting a lot of happily ever after endings from these stories, you'd be in for a surprise. There are some of those here for sure, but you have another thing coming if you're expecting to find those feel good endings you may have preconceived notions about. I think these are very different from the stories I heard as a kid. I do like the authenticity of the writing and I can see how some readers would think that these stories can be very ""harsh"". Overall, I enjoyed these stories and liked being able to break them down from varying viewpoints as an adult. Love Andersen everything, I have already read most of these just wanted it on hand so I could read them again and maybe find a couple I haven't read. My kid likes it! Something Everyone Should Keep In Their Library. The stories of Hans Christian Anderson, even the lesser ones, are all worth reading, so my negative review is not about the stories themselves. I enjoyed the stories I read. But I was very disappointed in this particular collection and how it was marketed in a misleading manner.. It was very incomplete, lacking many of Anderson's most well-known works. Both the listing biography and the ""most helpful"" customer review suggested this was the complete tales of Anderson, which it is not! Missing from this volume are The Little Mermaid, The Ugly Duckling, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, Thumbelina, and The Nightingale, among others. When you get something like this for free, you sometimes get what it's worth. In this day and age it is a pleasure to read and at the price its a no brainer... Really good to read on kindle Great read on kindle Free great product"
Poirot Investigates (AmazonClassics Edition),"An impossible grand theft in a posh Brighton hotel. The locked-room murder of an Italian nobleman. The suspicious suicide of a man worth more dead than alive.
What are the motives behind these puzzling crimes? In Agatha Christie’s first collection of short stories, eleven mysteries in all, detective Hercule Poirot makes his investigations. Leave it to the unflappable Belgian sleuth and his partner, Captain Arthur Hastings, to put the pieces together.
Revised edition: Previously published as Poirot Investigates, this edition of Poirot Investigates (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. ""Poirot Investigates"" is a captivating collection of short stories by Agatha Christie that brilliantly showcases the detective prowess of Hercule Poirot. Each story is a masterclass in concise, compelling mystery writing, filled with intriguing plots and Christie's signature twists.

The charm of this collection lies in the variety of cases Poirot tackles, ranging from thefts and disappearances to complex murders, each one deftly unravelled with his trademark 'little grey cells.' Christie's writing is sharp and engaging, keeping readers on the edge of their seats as they follow Poirot's meticulous and logical approach to solving each mystery.

Poirot's character is as delightful as ever, with his impeccable manners, sharp wit, and unerring confidence in his abilities. His interactions with Captain Hastings add a touch of humor and warmth, making the stories not just intellectually stimulating but also deeply enjoyable.

Overall, ""Poirot Investigates"" is a testament to Agatha Christie's genius as a storyteller. It's a must-read for any mystery enthusiast and a wonderful introduction to one of literature's most beloved detectives. This is a group of stories. Most of these stories I have read in longer form. They are very good and entertaining. As always things don't go.the way imagined. J thought I had secured the solution to several but with a twist I was proven wrong. The stories themselves are all well and good. However, the ebook is missing half of The Kidnapped Prime Minister and is also poorly formatted, thinking that all of the stories are on page 6. Quick reads and always well written. Never knew Ms. Christie did these short tales. Delightful just at bedtime. Enjoy these reads. Good stories, all making sense and with the delightful rapport of Hastings and Poirot. Quickies for Poirot die-hards that enjoy appetizers for the more profound, longer stories. I've always loved the Inspector and his little grey cells. He's a great character and his deductive powers are amazing. I always find myself more like Hastings when I'm trying to figure out who did it. ...you're going to really enjoy this audiobook series. It features David Suchet, in his most famous role of Hercule Poirot, as he mesmirizes the listener with his readings of these favorite Agatha Christie stories. What I was most fascinated with was his ability to slip from character to character, using all the appropriate voices and accents. It's amazing to hear him go from the Belgian Detective Poirot to the British Captain Hastings to a more cockney Inspector Japp to a rich female dowager on a cruise--and every character in between. Who knew?!!

The disks arrived in a nice multi-folded jacket and were all in good shape. The quality of the sound was very good, although every so often it seemed a little bit low--I just turned up the volume a bit. I thoroughly enjoyed listenting to each disk and was sad when I played the last one. But like a good book, it's easy to start again from the beginning. I highly recommend this set. Great read. No wonder why Agatha Christie is considered one of the greatest writers of all time!

11 stories, 11 cases, 11 mysteries cleverly written in a way that makes you guess to be surprised and amazed at the end. It’s so impressive how she is able to write stories in a way that keeps you guessing and end up wrong m, no matter how right you think you are.

A book very hard to put down once you started. Histórias curtas, mas mesmo assim interessantes ポアロの短編は少しあっさりしすぎている感があって読み返すことは少ないのですが、このCDは何度聞いても楽しめました。それというのも、ナレーターがPBSのドラマのポアロ役のDavid Suchetなのです。さすが名優、声としゃべり方の使い分けが素晴らしい。ポアロのときはもちろんあのポアロで、ヘイスティングのときは英国紳士風、と、テレビドラマを見ている（聴いている）ようです。 Ordine puntuale e tutto ok. Il libro è meraviglioso, l'ho preso per leggere in lingua ed aiutarmi a migliorare il mio inglese. Non mi sembra difficilissimo però un B2 credo serva per poterlo apprezzare."
Emily of New Moon (AmazonClassics Edition),"After Emily Starr loses her dear father, the ten-year-old orphan is packed off to live with her starched relatives on Prince Edward Island. If only she could relate to them. Frankly, whip-smart, ambitious Emily can’t imagine ever feeling at home at New Moon Farm. Especially when her writerly dreams are routinely dashed by her autocratic aunt. Then Emily finds an outlet for her creative spirit with a group of friends every bit as passionate and gifted as she. With their help, New Moon could start to feel like home after all.
Lucy Maud Montgomery’s semiautobiographical coming-of-age tale is a bittersweet ode to family, friendship, and forging your own path in life.
Revised edition: Previously published as Emily of New Moon, this edition of Emily of New Moon (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This review is based on a hardcover edition of this novel which I believe to be unabridged. I came to the book due to the recent Canadian Television Series, and though I've enjoyed that series very much, I find the book is altogether quite different from the series. It held my interest from the first page, and I was deeply moved by the entire achievement. Little Emily in this novel is a writer, a child with the heart and soul of a poet/prose writer who is immensely sensitive to the beauty around her on Prince Edward Island where she is growing up. Her closest friends, Teddy and Ilse, are also highly creative; and the soul of the novel has to do with the passion and courage of Emily in a world where vulnerable creative personalities meet with general bias as well as specific obstacles to their development every day. For me, the strongest and most arresting passages in the book have to do with nature as Emily sees it and moves through it.... trees, woodlands, coastal areas, gardens both natural and created, and the neverending panorama of changing skies. It is worth noting that Emily sees as much beauty in winter around her as she sees in spring or summer; and when she feels deeply, her joy is mingled with pain. Her soul opens when she is given opportunities to write down her thoughts; and the act of writing is therapeutic for her; and over the course of the novel she grows in insight and strength. ----- ------- There is much more to be said about this book. It is part of group of novels of the period that dealt with appealing orphans placed in homes where they had to win over the unsympathetic guardians who burdened with their care. And much can be said about the metaphor of the orphan, and why these books attained such popularity. ---- Another key aspect of the novel is that it takes the mind and soul of a child completely seriously, and does not shrink from strong condemnations of those who are rude and abusive to children. It is not written per se for children; but it is written by some one for whom the child is a full human being. ----------- I do want to explore those aspects of the book (and others) as I continue to read Lucy Maud Montgomery but the primary value of this novel for me is that Emily is a writer; and I think there is much here to comfort, encourage and inspire writers of all ages. The novel rings true. The novel is not just for children. The novel transcends time. I recommend this to anyone interested in the dilemma or the adventure of the creative child, the child who is a dreamer, the child who sees miracles in the physical world all around her, the child whose soul longs to write or paint or make art in any form. This is lovely novel, and it is a strong one and reading it was a rare pleasure. ------ One last note. When I finished it I thought at once of ""Martin Eden"" by Jack London. That is a book about an adult, and a much darker book. It is wholly different book, and it provides a deeply disturbing ending that many might find disappointing. But ""Martin Eden"" also about a writer, about the anguishing struggles of a sensitive soul who longs to be surrounded by beauty and to make beauty. ----- I recommend both books very much. I loved this book as a tween girl and I love it as an adult. Lucy Maud Montgomery was an exceptional writer! A very charming story of a young girl growing up in PEI, an island in eastern Canada. The rest of the series, Emily Climbs and Emily's Quest make this 3 part series very touching and heat-warming. Any girl 10-90 will love all three books in this trilogy. Fit for the dreamers., the misfits, the odd ones. Story declines at the end, but the descriptive writing is worth the time. Loved this book and honestly didn't think I would. Emily is clever, sassy and mature beyond her years. very well written and kept my interest. Read it for our women's book club at church. Recommend! I recognized the authors name but couldn't remember her books for a short time until I connected the name to Anne of Green Gables which I read many times when I was young. Her characters are so colorful and interesting. I found this story pretty interesting. I love poetry! Parts of it were okay. But, I thought the rest was pretty good. When I was a child, I found the story of Emily after reading most of the Anne of Green Gables series. I remember LOVING Emily for the brave heroine she seemed to be. I recently bought the books again and just finished the first book. I didn't realize how much Emily has declined in my admiration over the years.

After her father dies of consumption, Emily's mother's siblings gather to decide who she will live with. When her sour Aunt Elizabeth wins responsibility, Emily is taken to the family farm, New Moon, where tradition and pride are the hallmarks (or hindrances). Aunt Elizabeth's sternness is tempered by Aunt Laura's kindness; Cousin Jimmy, the lone male on the place, provides a sympathetic ear to Emily's spirit, much like Matthew did in the Anne books. When Emily starts school, she makes friends with Teddy, Ilse, and Perry, three neighborhood children. As a group, they negotiate the next two years with most of the action centering around Emily getting into trouble; not only does she have to be rescued when she falls over a cliff, she cuts a bang after being forbidden to do that, and then cuts off the rest of her hair to try to hide what she had done. Emily charms most of the people she meets and wins their heart, but can she win over the heart of Aunt Elizabeth?

This was an OK book, but it wasn't as good as I remember. Aunt Elizabeth is far too un-relenting; we only get momentary glimpses of her real concern for her niece til the end, when she gets mad at Emily for writing the truth about her. What does the woman expect after how she has treated her and they spend the whole book arguing? I found Emily's psychic episode a little unbelievable, coming out of the blue; their explanation is a little too pat, that the great-granmdother had the second sight. And, it may just be my adult nature, but what human being gets into this many ""scrapes""? I was klutzy, but the child falls over a cliff picking flowers!

And that brings me to a slightly troubling topic. It's fairly obvious Dean Priest is romantically interested in Emily. This would be fine, except he's old enough to be her father, he knew her father in college, and she's 12! He tells her he will be the one to teach her the romantic talk, he visits her when she is sick there are several other things he does that set off my creepy meter. I couldn't understand how her family didn't question his intentions. Even setting aside the fact that young girls married older men in those days and it was more acceptable, there is a 20-something year age difference that is unappealing.

I am going to read the other two books in the series, but I'm not sure if I want to share these books with my child. Til I decide, I'll stick with Anne of Green Gables. It's definitely a classic and well written . But somehow it just misses the must read status of say Anne of Green Gables or Rebecca of Sunnybrook farm. Keep in mind this is from the male perspective . I put it in the same field but above The Story Girl and Golden Road. It has a nice period feel with an engaging orphan character as well as an interesting collection of supporting characters . While it takes place on P.E.I it does have a different feel to it. It's worth rounding out you're reading it just may not be a title you'll revist like LM Montgomery's other books. This author had not been really known in my country and I enjoy reading this story. I first watched the anime that's how I got to read this. I had a lot of fun following the characters and see the bonds between Emily and the family but also with her friends. I am enthralled by her passion for writing and it is interesting to see the feedback she received. It's also good for amateur writers to follow the advice given. Realistic story. It's a birthday gift, I'm sure it will be well received.
I love the design of the front page, it's beautiful, I kind of felt that I would like to keep it for myself.
Highly recommend Ich freue mich über einen Klassiker in englisch zu diesem Preis. Das Buch sieht neu aus und kam pünktlich und unbeschadet an. Die Seiten sind sehr dünn und ich mag das. Ideal zum mitnehmen, da platzsparend. I had never read the Emily books. I can't begin to describe the joy I feel from reading this book. All my memories of being a young girl come flooding back. It is quite a delicious feeling. Ho letto tutta la saga di Anna dai capelli rossi e mi sono innamorata di questa scrittrice.. incuriosita da questa trilogia ho acquistato il primo romanzo e devo dire che l'ho adorato! Mi è piaciuto forse anche di più di Anna.. e non vedo l'ora che esca il secondo romanzo. Consigliatissimo!"
The Tempest (AmazonClassics Edition),"For years, Prospero, sorcerer and overthrown Duke of Milan, and his daughter, Miranda, have been marooned on an island of magic, both good and evil. When a ship carrying his usurping brother sails within the realm of his power, Prospero unleashes a storm that leaves the crew washed ashore, separated, and vulnerable to his enchantments—and open to forgiveness, repentance, and love.
Given its themes of reconciliation and closure, and its references to the dissolution of “the great globe,” this tragicomedy of illusion and the supernatural is believed by some critics to be Shakespeare’s spellbinding farewell to the stage.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Tempest, this edition of The Tempest (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This Kindle edition of Shakespeare's late (some think final) play, ""The Tempest,"" is in fact two books in one, both illustrated, both from around the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. The text of the book has no pretensions to be a scholarly contribution, or an aide to students, or even a guide for would-be actors or directors. It is just an attractive presentation of a one of Shakespeare's most tightly-constructed plays, with a supplement.

Since I just reviewed the ""Norton Critical Edition"" of the play, with its textual notes, glosses to the text, and selected source-texts and critical essays, I found this a welcome change.

The first of the two is a 1901 illustrated edition, the work of Robert Anning Bell: about eighty full, half, and quarter-page illustrations and page decorations. with the text of the then-current ""Cambridge Edition."" This is reproduced with some loss; the text combined with pictures is omitted, and a separate digital text provided; half the front end-paper is missing; facing pages no longer face each other. However, the reproduction of the art is crisp and clean. The cover art has been colored, which definitely adds to the clarity. Since the text of ""The Tempest"" is in unusually good condition, the lack of annotations or glossary is a relatively minor concern. However, unless you've read the play before, having an annotated or glossed edition handy might be useful.

Those curious about the differences between the print and Kindle versions can check using two digitalized copies (in different states of repair, and slightly sepia-toned) on the Library of Congress site (archive.org); search under the illustrator's name, it is a lot easier than sorting through pages of Shakespeare!

Bell's illustrations from time to time remind me of Aubrey Beardsley's illustrations to Malory's ""Morte D'Arthur"" and of the Waite-Ryder Tarot deck. The general description of the style as art nouveau, without reference to specific influences, is reasonable. His version of the half-human (we are told) Caliban looks something like a Skrull (old foes of The Fantastic Four, as Marvel fans may recall), and something like a marooned Vulcan (which I don't think needs an explanation yet).

The second part is a set of eight full-page illustrations to the play by the famous illustrator Walter Crane, originally published by Dent in 1894. The Kindle versions of these are supposed to be in high resolution, and they show up crisp and clear on my monitor. What purports to be a separate Kindle edition of these illustrations by Crane was apparently transferred from Project Gutenberg, and, somehow, the art is actually missing -- it just has the selected texts Crane chose to illustrate. (Of course, that version is free, so your only loss will be a little time and frustration.) Crane, best known today for his groundbreaking illustrations for children's books, does a good job with the Shakespearean setting and characters. In his case, I think I see reflections of the Pre-Raphaelites, in particular Burne-Jones -- but an art historian may see it as a matter of period styles. Crane's illustrations also appeared in a 1908 edition by Oliver Smeaton (Henry Holt, New York), and possibly elsewhere.

For those not already familiar with the play, it is one of the few Shakespeare works without a recognizable source for the main plot, although there is documentation for many details in the voyage literature of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century. Most of the other parallels which have been suggested are too general to tie to the play, or just too distant. The mysterious magician, his beautiful daughter, the handsome young hero, the magician's attendant spirits -- all the commonplaces of traditional fairytales and romances and of the commedia dell'arte, too. (G. Wilson Knight even found some parallels in the Ming Dynasty novel ""Journey to the West,"" otherwise known as ""Monkey,"" to the relations of Prospero to Ariel and Caliban; see his ""The Crown of Life,"" pages 229-230.)

Of course, this works the other way, as well. For some time I've consider ""The Tempest"" to be a fore-runner, if not an ancestor, of much genre fantasy. It is all there; the elaborate back-story, the conniving courtiers, the magician's seemingly arbitrary actions, the touchingly naive heroine, and the magical apparatus. Leaving aside the constraints of the stage, and the glorious language, the main difference I can see is that in ""The Tempest"" there is serious question of whether evil should be punished, or if the evil-doers should be forgiven, and vengeance, and the evils it generates, be forsaken. Shakespeare, the greatest writer of the English language. The Tempest is one of his shortest easier to follow plays. I highly recommend! One of my favorite shakespeare stories. love it As part of the Book Riot Read Harder Challenge, I needed to read a play and what better play to read than “The Tempest” having recently read and adored Margaret Atwood’s retelling in “Hag-Seed.” I have an even greater appreciation of “Hag-Seed” having read the original again. It had been more than twenty years since I’ve read Shakespeare. I found it simultaneously difficult to navigate the Old English and thematically extremely relevant to modern day. There is so much complexity within this brief play, that it is no wonder that people study Shakespeare to such lengths!

This play takes place on an Island where the magician, Prospero, and his daughter Miranda have been living the last 12 years, since Prospero’s exile from his position as Duke of Milan. The only other person on the Island during this time is Calaban, son of the evil witch, Sycorax, who used to live there as well. Ariel is a fairy who does the bidding of Prospero. Calaban is also enslaved to Prospero, having attempted to rape Miranda. Prospero creates a tempest which bring his enemies by shipwreck to his Island. He scatters them across the Island such that Ferdinand the King’s son is separated from all others and will encounter Miranda, both falling in love with each other under Ariel’s spell. Gonzalo, Alonso, Antonio, and Sebastian are landed together. During their time on the Island, Antonio and Sebastian plot against the king’s (Alonso’s) life, assuming that Ferdinand has perished. Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano develop an alliance that intends to murder Prospero, so that they can take over the island. Finally, all come together. Prospero, with urging from Ariel, forgives all and all is calm. Prospero, a thinly disguised Shakespeare, asks for applause to end his imprisonment.

There is much duality of humanity and the world represented within this play. Themes of good versus evil, magical vs earthly, land versus sea, honest versus dishonest, free versus imprisoned, sober versus drunk pervade this play. I loved the infusion of music, poetry and magic within this play. There is obvious brilliance to the themes and the structure of the play. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and found many unique characteristics setting it apart from some of Shakespeare’s other works that I’ve read. Livro em formato digital enviado diretamente para o Kindle. Muito rápido e formato ótimo. Tempest by Shakespeare is one of the best work of Shakespeare's time. Caliban is the man of all times. Must read if you want to get into the world of Shakespeare Muy didactico Gerne wieder Pas de problème, livre reçu (pas très rapidement, certes) mais en très bonne état ! Livre de bonne qualité, semble solide, édition intéressante. Je le conseille !"
Leaves of Grass (AmazonClassics Edition),"Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the transcendentalist movement, Walt Whitman’s groundbreaking collection of poetry broke from the meditative traditions of the symbolic, the allegorical, and the religious. Instead, Whitman celebrated the natural world—and humanity’s individual connection with it.
In elevating the human mind, and daring to embrace the human body and its pleasures, Whitman, often called the father of free verse, composed one of the most influential and controversial works of American literature.
Revised edition: Previously published as Leaves of Grass, this edition of Leaves of Grass (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This paperback is much nicer than I thought it would be, larger and nice print. Great product I don’t particularly like his works, but this book was way too good looking to pass up on. Arrived at my door in perfect condition as well Like listening to a very good friend who drones on and on, but you listen because you know he is going to say something really worth waiting for.

I knew little about Whitman or Leaves of Grass. I had read or heard some quotes which I liked, so I started reading. At first it was very annoying! He used exclamation points at the end of every sentence! (Or if not an exclamation, he put it all in parentheses.) Again and again with the exclamation points! (Again and again with the parentheses.) And the subjects I did not find that interesting, or the wording very well formed.

The first 3rd of the book is a collection of random thoughts, mostly about how great America is. On and on about things he might just have read about in the newspaper, with very little evidence of personal experience. List after list. And when he was not writing about America, he was writing about being gay. Now I don't know if he was or was not, I only know what I read; and it sure seemed gay to me. I just did not see what was so great about this book. What I did not realize at the time was that I was being introduced to his voice, his individual way of expressing himself.

The middle 3rd of the book has as its subject the Civil War. Here he comes into his own. I could feel his horror, his empty numbness, his pride and his despair. Nearly every poem is a gem, nearly every thought, a revelation. One exception is ""O Captain! My Captain!, which although great poetry, is not written in the voice I had come to know. It seems to me to have been written for general consumption, not in the private, personal style of the rest of the book.

The last 3rd of the book is the recovery from, or rather ghosts from, the Civil War; and also about becoming old. Again here, I had to be patient and wade through quite a few verses to find something that spoke to me. The wounds from the war were real, the dreams acquiring the patina of chivalry. Also, as with most folks now growing old, he was old a long time. He tended to repeat himself and complain about the maladies of being old again and again... as we do.

This is a personal life's journey of one man, in his unique voice. I am glad he shared it with me.

(The kindle edition I read had some formatting issues, but the Amazon website indicates that is being corrected). I am very happy that inexpensive versions of Leaves of Grass are available again. I have purchased eight different versions to compare. Many are very poorly put together - almost like scanned versions simply plopped into a word processor and uploaded to Amazon - and selling for $10 - $1. What I find most fascinating is this one - by Martino Fine Books (listed as Leaves of Grass ; {exact Facsimile of the 1855 Edition] - it is very fine, and is an exact facsimile. I love holding it and looking at it as close to the original 1855 edition as humanly possible. The only caveat is the cover - which features the older Walt, who had published six more versions by the time the cover photo was taken. No matter, the inside is what's important. Another one I bought that I recommend is from cholla needles press (listed as Leaves of Grass: 1855) - they use a facsimile of the original cover, and have made the choice to clean up the line breaks for readability purposes. The cholla edition is easy to sit down and read, the martino edition is beautiful to look at. The good news is I bought them both for less than $10 and find that reasonable enough to give them both to friends and relatives as gifts this year. Whitman wrote as if to me personally. He picked me out as someone many years hence from his perspective, in order to share his world in sufficient detail for me to insert myself into his skin. Through what he put down he came forward more than a hundred years. He is sauntering, noticing the sounds, sights, smells, how he lit up with joy, bittersweetness, fear, self doubt and at times loneliness. He carried me along the river bank at any pace I wanted to go. He would not miss a stride as he adapted to my pace. He taught me how to recline in the summer grass in the cemetery not much more than a stone's throw from where I live, and meditate on his leaf of green summer grass, inviting my soul to enter our picture. I am writing this as a message, an invitation for you, my reader, to get to know Walt Whitman. Don't join the crowd of hate and be put off by the fact that he was gay.

I am learning much about making healthy connections, being myself one of the dots I am connecting. I do a little Lazarus raising activity in the cemetery two or three times a week, as I bring back to life my parents, my mother's parents, and her mother's mothers parents. They are in my mind, what I remember and imagine of them, increasingly clearly. There is so much more good will, mutual respect and intimacy aware to me now. I even have group therapy with them.

I learned a lot about how to do this from carrying on with Walt Whitman! Very pleased with this book would buy this again without a question wish my entire collection was as good as this volume A great poet. A wonderful book. I recommend it. This is an excellent edition of Leaves of Grass. I was looking specifically for the poem Song of the Open Road, and was disappointed that it isn't included in this version, but came to learn that Whitman produced several successive editions of the book, with changes and additions in each newer version. So, I'll keep looking for a book that includes that poem. PFA
1. The cover.
2. The back.
3. The contents page (I highlighted that area and that pencil mark is mine)
4. The first page of the book.
5. A random page to show the font (with my hand as reference).

No issues with binding. Beautiful. I have had this book for months and no issues over time.
Very easy to read because it's free verse (Walt Whitman is called the father of free verse poetry). Lovely book, used this for my english coursework and it was an enjoyable read. Whitman really encapsulates what it meant to be a common American man in his era and it makes sense why his influence is still prevalent in modern day America (Lana Del Rey). Hope his legacy lives on for he really is one of America's greatest poets. His free verse style allows the reader to be taken to wherever his mind wanders to, really great stuff.

In terms of the book itself, its very good quality and well worth the money. Wie wahrscheinlich viele auch, hat mich Walther White auf dieses Buch gebracht. Die alte Socke.
Ich glaube, Walt Whitman ist in Deutschland nicht wirklich ein großer Begriff, aber seine Gedichte sind exzellent (sofern man sie auf englisch liest und mehr weiß als die Wörter aus der Schule). Mit seinen Schilderungen belebt er in mir das Land Amerika, seine Natur, seine Vergangenheit, seine ganz einzelnen Vorgänge in den Straßen der Städte. Vor allem spürt man auch die große Freiheit, die dieses Land birgt. Die Reise geht von Manhattan in die Rockys, in die Prärie und an die Küsten der Meere. Whitman verwendet keine klischeehaften Sätze, um das zu beschreiben, was er beschreiben will. Er erfindet besondere Formulierungen, die die Natur und das Leben ganz besonders hervorheben und spürbar machen.
Ich kann Freunden von Gedichten ""Leaves of Grass"" nur empfehlen, am besten auf englisch. Man kann daraus lernen...und darin versinken.

Whitman erinnert mich übrigens ungemein an Prophet Combstock aus ""BioShock Infinite""...wer dessen originale Stimme kennt, für den klingen meiner Meinung nach die Gedicht ganz besonders :)

The Pursuit of God (AmazonClassics Edition),"A soul-searching reflection on spirituality, A. W. Tozer’s The Pursuit of God has been regarded as a classic Christian work since its publication in 1948. Tozer, a beloved, self-taught pastor, implores the reader to let go of material comforts to best cultivate a deeper spiritual life focused on the teachings of Christ. Tozer and his wife were firm practitioners of what he preached; the couple never owned a car and despite the success he found as a Christian writer, never profited greatly, as he donated much of his royalties to those in need.
Tozer’s The Pursuit of God is a spiritual meditation of timeless importance that has encouraged generations of readers to live more simply and deepen their relationships with God.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from iconic authors. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or revisit an old favorite, these new editions open the door to the stories and ideas that have shaped our world.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Pursuit of God, this edition of The Pursuit of God (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This book raises so many thoughts and ideas to give serious thought to. Very convicting and well written. A must read for any people looking to seriously pursue God deeper. This is my second reading of Tozer's Pursuit! I world highly recommended it to be initially read or a return to its pages! Every believer needs a reminder that God is near now and pursues us first, way before we pursue Him! A.W. reminds us and gives proper instructions, within these pages, how to live an abundant and free life in Jesus Christ! The Pursuit of God, a Christian classic, is a deep look into how a spiritually enriched life can blossom if we each, individually, decide to follow God's call.

""We pursue God because, and only because, He has first put an urge within us that spurs us to the pursuit.... and all the time we are pursuing Him we are already in His hand."" (The Pursuit of God)

Written in 1948 by American preacher A. W. Tozer (1897-1963), it's amazing to see how many points that Tozer brought across of his own time period that parallel, and perhaps have even intensified, in our modern times. One thought that stood out to me, for an example, is that believers not associated with work in ministry have sometimes quit pursuing Christ because they think they are in a happy place in their relationship with Him.

""We have been snared in the coils of a spurious logic which insists that if we have found Him we need no more seek Him."" (The Pursuit of God)

The author covers many topics throughout the ten chapters, such as:
* Complacency in faith
* Carrying the burden of artificiality
* Wrongly dividing the unseen and the physical into two different worlds
* Worries of the church drifting into a secular attitude
* Overall spiritual development

""Faith is a redirecting of our sight, a getting out of the focus of our own vision and getting God into focus."" (The Pursuit of God)

Many truths are found within the pages of The Pursuit of God. I definitely recommend it for Christian readers, as the book contains many good points to think about, concerning spiritual life. I personally enjoyed The Pursuit of God and A. W. Tozer's writing. I now look forward to reading more of his works one day.

If you're interested in reading this book too, you may find it handy to locate a free e-book version of it available through Project Gutenberg, Librivox, Amazon Kindle, or from many other resources.

*For those reading this particular annotated e-book edition, the last 30% of the book is just a list of other recommended works from the same publisher -- not actual reading. I had never read nor heard from this author before, yet, a short book and very powerful. Every one should be reading this book, it's full of insights that are very interesting and helpful. I love how the author didn't sugar-coated the facts. The prayers at the end of each chapter were beautiful, almost poetic. Highly recommend. In all of my years growing up as a ""conservative evangelical""... I heard of A.W. Tozer quite often, but I have just now stopped to read my first Tozer book. After reading Tozer's ""The Pursuit of God: The Human Thirst for the Divine"", I can't help but wonder if all those preachers and teachers were speaking of another A.W. Tozer. I keep thinking, ""How did they miss this?""

Tozer writes of spiritual things, not of the religious outward works of the flesh. His concern is that we all might tune in our spiritual receptors and begin letting the Lord take us deeper into him. I resonated with this book in many things the Lord is presently teaching me.

Tozer writes, ""We have almost forgotten that God is a person and, as such, can be cultivated as any person can. It is inherent in personality to be able to know other personalities, but full knowledge of one personality by another cannot be achieved in one encounter.""

He goes on to say,""God is a person, and in the deep of His mighty nature He thinks, wills, enjoys, feels, loves, desires and suffers as any other person may... He communicates with us through the avenues of our minds, our wills, and our emotions.""

Yet, we must know that it is through the inner man (i.e. our spirit) that Christ's life governs the soul life and the body. Watchman Nee has written an excellent work regarding this matter. I encourage you to read ""The Spiritual Man"" and ""The Release of the Spirit.""

Tozer has done a great thing to point out the flaws of the ""smug and content"" churches in America. Christ's 'forgiveness of sins' seems to be the resting place of most Christians... never moving on in purusit of Christ in all things. These people settle for programs, passions, ministries, and movements... they never grow up into Christ.

Tozer writes, ""Why do some persons ""find"" God in a way that others do not?"" He answers, ""The difference lies not with God but with us.""

If I could sum up this book in one phrase... it would be: SPIRITUAL RECEPTIVITY. Tozer beckons us to press on to Christ in God as person, not as a floating spirit hovering on the ceiling during worship and prayer time. Those who follow the urge to press on further into Christ and do something about that urge instead of ignoring it... will know the depths and the riches of the Living God.

We must move on past our doctrinal knowledge of God and enter into Christ, the Person. Tozer writes, ""the highest love of God is not intellectual, it is spiritual. God is Spirit and only the spirit of a man can know Him really.""

There are many who will label this kind of book as ""Christian mysticism"" or ""the deeper Christian life"". I am uncomfortable with using both of these phrases regularly... and lean toward not using them at all. The confusion comes by a failure to distinguish between what is ""normal"" and what is ""common"".

What I mean is... it may not be common for man to speak of experience with Christ in the way of a Tozer, Sparks, Nee, Merton, or Madame Guyon. Nevertheless, it is not abnormal and should not be considered ""deeper"" or ""mystical"". These are not words used of the first disciples and I see them being completely unnecessary, and even distracting, when speaking of the normal Christian life Christ has lived, died, and been resurrected to freely give to all.

The apostle Paul spoke of the life of Christ in the same way as the so-called ""mystical"" Christian writers. We should not think that Paul was speaking of life that only a few can experience. Coming into the life that is described by Paul and many of the Christian ""mystics""... is nothing deserving of any name or title other than the normal worship of Christ, the Person of God.

We should understand this ""deeper"" part of our journey with Christ as being a normal progression of the working out of salvation and us being made complete in Christ (Phil. 2:12; Col. 2:2-3). These unnecessary words and phrases do not put the emphasis on the person of Christ, but on the person who worships him. I see no need for the distractive adjectives and the luring language of super Christians.

I also recommend reading: It exposes very clearly several aspects of God A true classic. Indian Christianity is polluted by false teachers who preach lies. This book will truly help you understand why God created human beings and only a personal relationship with God through Christ can satisfy us. Tozer, as usual never disappoints ""O God, be thou exalted over my possessions. Nothing of earth’s treasures shall seem dear unto me if only Thou art glorified in my life. Be Thou exalted over my friendships. I am determined that Thou shalt be above all, though I must stand deserted and alone in the midst of the earth. Be Thou exalted above my comforts. Though it mean the loss of bodily comforts and the carrying of heavy crosses I shall keep my vow made this day before Thee...""

Such prayers are no more heard in today's christianity.

A BOOK THAT WILL PLACE YOU BACK IN TRUE CHRISTIANITY! Assunto de grande importância e é dado com clareza. O autor fala de modo simples e poderoso. Muito bom mesmo. Louvado seja Deus por ter sentado homens para escrever sobre estás coisas."
Uncle Tom's Cabin (AmazonClassics Edition),"When a Kentucky farmer is forced to sell two slaves to a plantation owner, it becomes a turning point in the lives of both slaves. For Eliza, it’s one of escape—a harrowing flight north with her young son. For Uncle Tom, sent down the Mississippi River, it’s a more certain fate, as he struggles to survive against the brutal exploitation of his traders.
As the single most popular novel of its era, Stowe’s volatile work of protest fiction fueled the abolitionist cause in the 1850s. The book personalized the plight of slavery in a way that political speeches and newspapers could not. Stowe’s humanistic approach ignited a national argument, one credited by historians as a key contributor to the outbreak of the Civil War.
Revised edition: Previously published as Uncle Tom's Cabin, this edition of Uncle Tom's Cabin (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This story of 19th Century slave culture is foreign to our present consciousness; that is why we should require its reading for high school students. It presents the domestic world of the 19th Century, social attitudes, beliefs and socially accepted illusions, political developments, and their effects on people of differing social classes in a vivid and memorable way. How does a society tolerate such an evil as slavery? This novel helps us understand that people of many societies accommodate evil to some extent or another, and confronts us with the issue of our willingness to pay the price to do what is right. This may be the reason why those who believe in “progress” are reluctant to read this ground-breaking novel, for it pierces the self-satisfaction of those who simply do what is socially accepted, and point out that human virtue and goodness are rather rare in every society.

For example, the New England woman who comes South to assist her cousin St. Claire care for his daughter Eva, because the mother is a self-persuaded invalid, is morally shocked by slavery, but also finds the Blacks repulsive. She must confront her own prejudice against the slave she is given to teach, and she must develop a caring relationship, a genuine love, before her teaching can overcome the slave-girl’s dysfunctional approach to life (arising from early neglect). In this, the child Eva, who has a genuine affection for the slave members of the household who have cared for her, leads the way, dying before adolescence leads her to that conforming to society which teaches us implicitly what evils to shun and which to tolerate and just accept without acknowledgment.

There is ample fodder in this story for the argument that society makes otherwise good people do evil things, in other words that structure molds our morals. It begins with a “good” Kentucky family which treats their slaves well. These latter include Uncle Tom who functions as a steward of the estate, even carrying sums of money unsupervised for his owner to other states, and returning. Also included is Eliza, married to a slave from another farm, and their son Jim Crowe. Eliza is a mulatto (half-Black/half white), with features appealing to white men, but she is safe in the family that owns her. However, the owner has taken financial chances and his debts have been bought up by a slave trader who threatens to foreclose, forcing the owner to sell his three most valuable slaves, Eliza, Tom, and Eliza’s amusing son. Finding it easier to act first and reconcile later, he makes the sale, but before the Eliza and son can be seized by the dealer, Eliza flees, and when she reaches the Ohio River, has to leap from ice floe to ice floe to escape into free territory. There by chance she meets up with her husband who has escaped from his resentful master at a Quaker settlement and they eventually make it to Ontario. By the end of their story, he has obtained an education in France, secured freedom in American law, but determines his identity to be with the African ancestors rather than his white ancestors and decides to settle in Liberia.

Tom, on the other hand, accepts his sale and separation from his wife and children as a trial and his treatment by the dealer is detailed, a mix of unnecessary humiliation, and relaxation of this for good behavior. On the river boat down to New Orleans, a wealthy man’s daughter, the Eva we spoke of earlier, takes a fancy to him, in part because of his gentleness and in part because of his skill in entertaining children with makeshift toys, etc. She persuades her father, St. Claire, to purchase him, and Tom finds himself part of this easy-going family. St. Claire inherited slaves with his brother, but while the brother had the firmness (and necessary cruelty) to keep his in order, St. Claire shrinks from becoming brutilized. His brother took after their father who was a worldly man, but he was more like his mother, a fervent Catholic who regarded the slaves, if not as equals, then at least as people worthy of respect and consideration. Having adopted a fashionable skeptic air, St. Claire struggles between these two poles of his life, and admires the dignity, faith, and integrity of Tom who becomes his spiritual mentor. St. Claire determines to give Tom his freedom, and even discusses it with his New England cousin who urges him not to delay. He insist that he has all the time in the world, and the next night goes to the tavern. In attempting to break up a fight he gets stabbed in the gut with a Bowie knife, dying the next day. Tom is again sold as the estate is liquidated and the hypochondriac widow returns to her father’s plantation.

Tom’s interim with other slaves is described as they await the day of their auction. They are well fed for healthy, cheerful slaves fetch the highest prices. The humiliation of prospective buyers who grope the slaves to feel their muscles (especially of the women) and the examination of teeth, as is done with horse-selling, is described with a restraint that allows the reader to react to the thing described rather than to the Author’s rhetoric. Tom, it turns out, is purchased by greedy ruffian, Simon Legree, a man determined to become rich by working his slaves as hard as he can, without paying heed to what others might think right or humane. Instead of a wife he takes a slave or two as mistress; similarly, the two slaves he can train to be his foremen he makes subordinate companions in drinking and amusement, if they can brutalize the others and so keep them working. Tom gets into trouble with these for assisting the slaves who fall behind in their work. He is warned by a slave woman who seems to be immune to the foremen’s threats, not to help others, just accept the way things are. Because he is cooperative and learns quickly, Legree thinks initially of making Tom a foreman; but when Tom refuses to degrade a woman by stripping her and administering a beating, Legree has Tom receive the beating, and treats him with the resentment he feels arising from the moral judgment implicit in Tom’s refusal to do what is beneath him.

Tom’s former owners in Kentucky, the wife and the son of the man who had sold him had promised to buy Tom’s freedom when they had the means, and when the husband/father passed away, their notion of honor was less tied up in preserving the family plantation and more in keeping their promise. Thus the son, now after eight years, a man of 20, comes to New Orleans to track down Tom, and finally comes to Simon Legree’s Arkansas plantation. Alas, Tom has just died in a selfless act, and Legree treats the dead slave with no more dignity that of a horse’s carcass, and allows the young man to have the body, which he buries decently before returning to Kentucky. The family agrees to free all their slaves but employ them on the farm if they chose. At this announcement, Tom’s example of faith, courage, and goodness to others is to be remembered every time they pass by Uncle Tom’s cabin.”

The story has several subplots which develop several personalities, for better or worse. Tom is clearly a Christ figure whose faith and suffering changes hearts and leads to the freedom of many of his people. Grace is present even in oppressive conditions. A strength of the writing is the various portraits of persons of different stations of life; the natural superiority of some persons over others, not by virtue of race but by moral sensitivity that transcends mere selfishness. The flaws in the slave system which allow one man to determine the fate of another, and to ignore the sacred ties of marriage and family for economic consideration are effectively exhibited. That many slaveholders saw themselves as kind, indulgent, and looking out for the good of their slaves is cheerfully portrayed; but their heirs or immediate family might have differing views which allow no consideration of the slave’s welfare to influence their decisions about them.

One criticism of the novel is that it is melodramatic. Eva, the child full of love for her flawed parents and the slaves in the household, who dies tragically early, may strain the reader’s credulity, but even here, the differing tastes of readers in the 1840’s may be a valuable lesson, comparable as it is to some of Charles Dickens' creations. Perhaps a more troublesome issue for modern readers, especially on the high school level is the use of the n-word, accepted then but regarded as intolerable today. Twain’s “Huckleberry Finn” has been banned from several high schools for that reason. But, if we can teach students to imitate the good and not the evil they encounter in literature, this should not be a definitive objection.

Few women can claim to have influenced American history as much as the author Harriet Beecher Stowe; and yet it is not fashionable to put her forth as a model for women today. Her strict moral outlook and appeal to Christian sensibilities, as well as her faithful representations of what people were like in 19th Century America is not congruent with Marxist-inspired wokeness which insists that traditional religion is the source rather than the enemy of social evil, and that in order to have influence we must break barriers rather than respect them. Similarly, the Marxist turn of the Civil Rights movement which tended to admire Malcom X rather than Martin Luther King has turned the very name of “Uncle Tom” into an epithet of contempt used for those who cowardly cooperate with the oppressor rather than fight for rights. This is ironic in that the book’s hero is, in fact, the most courageous and principled character in the book, admired and envied by every individual of good will. But not everyone wants to be a martyr, and it was (according to “The Root” website) a supporter of Marcus Garvey and his back-to-Africa movement who in a 1919 speech proclaimed separation rather than cooperation to be the only path for self-respecting Negros. It really boils down to what we regard as the salvation envisioned for American Blacks- if separation, then there is no use for Beecher’s hero; if the races are to live together in peace then the figure of Uncle Tom as a man of courage, integrity, and faith, is one to inspire emulation of all races. Uncle Tom's Cabin was a book I KNEW about, but only as a historical artifact--a story that helped ignite the Civil War....but little else. The trivial fact that it was the first American novel to sell 1,000,000 copies was tucked away in my mind, and the disparaging label of someone being called an ""Uncle Tom"" was about the extent of my knowledge of Stowe's masterpiece.

Now, having read the entire book, I am ashamed at having never taken the time before. The power in the narrative and the characters in the story is enough to keep you turning the pages to see what happens next! To my surprise, even though it is more than 150 years old, it was not difficult to understand...

UTC essentially tells two stories at once--two slaves are set to be sold from a Kentucky plantation/farm they have lived all their lives. One is the older, well-respected Uncle Tom, and the other is the young, pretty Eliza. Tom accepts his fate, confident in his faith that God will protect him. Eliza, fearful of losing her child (with good reason) decides to run away to Ohio, where she hopes to find freedom.

Along the way, both of these good souls have trials and tribulations...times of fear, hope, friendships and pain. Nothing is guaranteed for them....and sometimes their travels through life are blessed, and sometimes they are shook by sudden, unexpected pain.

Tom's journey from Kentucky is primarily south; to a land where generally slaves are subject to much rougher conditions than in his native border state. Eliza, of course, is going north to Ohio, and eventually, she hopes, to Canada. But fugitive slaves are still hunted in Ohio, so there are no guarantees.

The most difficult part of the reading for me was getting acclimated to the style in which Stowe portrays the conversation of the slaves. Because the language is more coarse, uneducated and casual, it took a little while to completely understand what a slave was saying. At times, I had to stop and ""sound out"" what the words were, just to get the jist of what was meant. After a little while, though, this became easier.

The most surprising aspect of the story...and perhaps this explains the current absence of Stowe's novel in the modern mind...was the unambiguous and unapologetic Christian timber replete throughout the pages. Stowe rightfully believed that true Christianity did not endorse the idea of one man being the property of another. In her day, some religious leaders excused slavery in the states by creating contrived arguments supposedly developed from the Bible. Stowe challenges those preposterous notions headon!

UTC is filled with direct references to Scripture and Christian hymns. Even one of the most irreligious characters, a one-time owner of Tom, Augustine St. Clare, is able to see how the slave trade is altogether UN-Christian, though he also finds it difficult to give up his ""servants"".

The deeply religious Quakers, who help run the fugitive slaves to freedom, are also portrayed as true followers of Jesus. Most touching is how they even tend to the injuries of an evil bounty hunter--a man who would have killed them if it meant recapturing a slave.

Uncle Tom's faith is described in great detail, and his ability to endure in times of want reminds one of the Old Testament story of Job. He strives to maintain trust in his Savior.

My review ends here; to give away the ending might discourage someone from picking up the story and reading it for themselves. The time spent absorbing Stowe's novel is well-spent. One can fully understand how it shook the conscience of the nation in the 1850s. I AM A CANADIAN LIVING IN CANADA, I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF AFRICAN SLAVERY WHEN MY WIFE AND I WATCHED ROOTS ON TELEVISION SOME YEARS AGO AND THEN WATCHED IT AGAIN A MONTH AGO.
I THEN NOTICED THAT AMAZON HAD ""UNCLE TOM'S CABIN "" AVAILABLE FOR MY KINDLE-NO CHARGE-
AFTER READING THE WHOLE STORY ON KINDLE, I BORROWED A VIDEO FROM OUR LOCAL LIBRARY ON THIS OLD MOVIE.""UNCLE TOM'S CABIN"". MY WIFE AND I WATCHED THIS AMAZING PORTRAYAL OF THE LIFE OF UNCLE TOM AND HIS FAMILY AND MASTERS. THE KINDLE STORY AND THE MOVIE ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL, HOWEVER THE BEATINGS AND LASHINGS THESE POOR AFRICAN PEOPLE RECEIVED FROM SOME OF THEIR MASTERS WAS GRUESOME. MY WIFE AND I HAD TO TURN AWAY AT TIMES. HOWEVER AS IT TURNS OUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE ACCEPTED THE BLACK RACE INTO THEIR OWN CULTURE, EVEN NOW VOTING IN A BLACK PRESIDENT FOR THE SECOND TERM. I AM VERY PROUD TO HAVE MY AMERICAN COUSINS LIVING CLOSE, JUST ACROSS FROM OUR COMBINED BORDER. THANK YOU TO OUR U.S. NEIGHBORS. perfect!!! La cruda realidad de los esclavos en el siglo XVIII y XIX. Aunque la esclavirud despues fue trasladada a los paises del tercer mundo Upfront I will say that this version is a exceptionally well-produced ebook and I can't say that about many. If you would like an ebook of this classic I highly recommend this one.

Onto the book itself. Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe was first published in 1852. I loved this book! We know looking back from the 21st century how authentic her story is but at the time of publication Stowe was telling it like it was and adding fuel to the highly charged slavery issue. With this book we see slavery written in the time of slavery, not in retrospect. Presented with every attitude and perspective of the era through characters are so memorable and a setting so vivid, the reader is taken into that reality and immersed. And while the reader is confronted with terrible cruelty and heartache, it is never unreadable. It is CLEVER. Harriet Beecher Stowe knows exactly what she's doing. She knows she's sucking her reader into an amazing unputdownable adventure while she is totally exposing the unspeakableness that is slavery in antebellum America. It is breathtaking. Everyone should read this book. This is an important and wonderful book that everyone should read.
But this edition that Amazon.es sell is appalling. The print is so small, and the lines so long that it is impossible to read. I ended up reading it on Kindle. They should never sell a book like this.
Moreover, the book was shipped from Germany! So in terms of delivery time there was absolutely no advantage compared with Amazon.co.uk. The one plus is you can choose a punto de recogida.
I will never order another English language book from Amazon.es."
Black Beauty (AmazonClassics Edition),"From the meadow of his youth to the crowded, frosty streets of London, Black Beauty tells the story of his life under many masters in Victorian England, among them the kind Squire Gordon, the principled Jeremiah Barker, and the exploitive Nicholas Skinner. No matter the circumstance, Beauty bears joy and hardship with grace, heeding his mother’s advice to be good, gentle, and hardworking—always.
At turns suspenseful, heartwarming, and heartbreaking, Black Beauty is a masterful tale promoting equality, compassion, and strength of character—and remains a treasured classic for animal lovers of all ages.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Black Beauty, this edition of Black Beauty (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. The success of Uncle Tom’s Cabin led abolitionist Frederick Douglass to write that “nothing could have better suited the moral and humane requirements of the hour. Its effect was amazing, instantaneous, and universal.” Recognizing this impact, Anna Sewell determined to write the “Uncle Tom’s Cabin of the horse,” as told from the perspective of an actual horse named Black Beauty.

Although Black Beauty wasn’t the first autobiography of an animal, the idea that a horse would have a life story to tell in his own words, detailing both the horrors and kindness he received from various masters, was revolutionary for the time. Sewell may have set out to do for horses what Harriet Beecher Stowe had done for African-descended slaves, but Black Beauty’s first-year sales quickly surpassed those of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, reaching international acclaim. Not all societies practiced human slavery, but virtually all of human civilization at that point was powered by equines who were forced to work under the constant threat of whipping or worse.

According to authors Bill Wasik and Monica Murphy, 19th century animal movement leaders like Massachusetts SCPA founder George Thorndike Angell “dreamed of creating a new literature of animal appreciation, and he succeeded beyond all expectation, launching one of the nineteenth century’s best-selling novels and helping thereby to create a whole new genre of animal storytelling.”

The popularization of Black Beauty by animal advocates like Angell sparked public outrage and real-world reforms, most notably the abolition of the check-rein — a device that painfully forced horses to keep their heads raised — and a campaign against tail-docking. But the book also forced readers simply to imagine what life must be like for a horse, encouraging readers to have empathy and give them a voice when they witnessed equine abuse, which was routine and widespread.

Black Beauty opened people’s eyes to the possibility that an animal could have a point of view. Horses were transformed in the story from mere commodities to individuals with personalities, likes and dislikes, and most importantly, a desire to avoid the suffering that humans so frequently deliver upon them. A cherished classic from the Victorian Era. As an English Major I have a whole new perspective on this novel than I once did, for Black Beauty is an authentic depiction of the treatment of animals during that era. Animals before were mainly seen as beast of burden, or submissive creatures beneath both God and man. However, the animal was coming into a new light, a light of intelligence and emotion, where-else before seen as simply dumb.
I won't bore you with all the historic significance of this novel, except that it turned many mind towards the well being of their animals and laws to be introduced for their health. Anna Sewell only book changed the world, alike to Charles Dickens 'Oliver Twist' to child labor, or Charlotte Brontë's 'Shirley' to feminism and the ""women-question.""

And any adult can enjoy Black Beauty, it is not a children's book but a masterpiece published to sway those who handled horses: ""a special aim [was] to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding treatment of horses"" - Anna Sewell. Also, a good companion to the unabridged classic is Warner Bros 1994 film starring Sean Bean (James Bond: Golden Eye, Game of Thrones), Andrew Knot (The Secret Garden), and David Thewlis (Harry Potter as Professor Lupin, Fargo), Jim Carter (Downton Abbey, Knightfall). It follows the book pretty well, with a few deviations (that I will not spoil for you).

Concerning the Scholastic Classics 2001 Edition, each chapter contain a lovely, detailed image with a few, smaller images here and there throughout the novel. Growing-up with this edition I felt the need to re-purchase it after losing my original copy. This edition is unabridged and has a green cover with an introduction by Gail Carson Levine, author of Ella Enchanted. Classic I’ve loved this book since I was a child and wanted another copy as mine is getting very worn. This was advertised as being the 1945 edition but what I received was the original 1911 Barse & Co edition so the item’s description needs to be updated. It is in good used condition. I’ll continue my search for the 1945 illustrated edition and treasure this book as well. A classic that reminds us all of kindness even to those you cannot speak. A book of hope and perseverance. This hardback book--the cover, binding, printing, original drawings--is better than I hoped for!! I bought this for grandson's 11th birthday since it was my favorite book as a child. I told him there are some stressful situations for Black Beauty, but not to worry as it has a happy ending. Others in his family want to read it too and I think partly because it's such an attractive book. Included a bookmark with it. I definitely recommend this version of Black Beauty. I had forgotten much about this book. I looked it up trying to find out about check reins . (I was not even sure that was their name.)
I hadn't read the book in decades.

The excitement was still there, but I had not noticed the moral lessons scattered throughout the story; both about the treatment of horses and other animals and about the treatment of fellow humans. I can see how it helped launch animal rights movements. I am glad that I read it again. Not only does it tell a beautiful story you get a coloring book too. It was a great book for what I paid. This is a well-written classic that I highly recommend, especially to animal lovers. I was disappointed, however, that the design on the cover is not sculpt-embossed as advertised, but just printed flat, as in a regular book. Nevertheless, this edition is still a welcome addition to my collection. Bought this for a child, as it was actually the first book I remember reading as a child myself. Recommend it highly. 映画を観て、ぜひ、原作を読んでみたかった。お話しは、馬 Black Beauty の、語りで、進んでいきます。やっぱり、ラストでジーンと、来ました。ハッピーエンドで、何よりのお話しです。1800年、後期に書かれた本。いやー、馬っていいですねえ! For the sad fact is that it's as pertinent now, as it was back when it was produced by Anna Sewell as a ""cry for help"" for the horses of her time.

Do a bit of research ... how many horse and pony sancturies are in your country? Visit them (online or in person) and check out the state in which some of their residents arrive at that place of care and safety. It'll touch your heart.

The book itself is beautifully written, though perhaps not for the under 10's - for in places it'll bring tears to the eyes. It's interesting though - and A.S. has captured a horse's ""take"" on life with humans well. Indeed Black Beauty and his friends often show quite a touch of that ""horse sense"" we humans talk about! We are of course glad for Beauty that his own story has a happy ending, with him living out his old age in love and safekeeping. But for many horses, ponies, donkeys, it's not so - this is 2009, and that is a disgraceful fact.

As with all Collector's Library books, this is a compact size and a lovely presentation of the story, with occasional good quality line drawings. Well worth a place on your bookshelf - for all all ages to read, and learn from. Tres beau livre - classique et parfait comme cadeau. Merci."
Heretics (AmazonClassics Edition),"In this 1905 collection of essays, G. K. Chesterton contests the growing intolerance for religious thinking and theological debate. He calls out friends and contemporaries—George Bernard Shaw, Rudyard Kipling, and H. G. Wells, among others—who hold divided views on art, literature, and politics but universally dismiss orthodox opinions on God and the cosmos.
As relevant today as when it was written, Heretics is a bracing challenge from one of the twentieth century’s wittiest and most influential Christian voices.
Revised edition: Previously published as Heretics, this edition of Heretics (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Unlike Chesterton, I am not Christian, much less Catholic. I identify with Montaigne or Thoreau and appreciate Twain. Yet, I have never read so much logical, wise and witty argument in a small book, with the exception of the great Dane Piet Hein's grooks (short poems very popular in English translation around 1970). Like Twain putting down the Judeo-Christianity of the Bible, or Wilde on the vogue for things Japanese, Chesterton the conservative will thrill all readers who enjoy carefully crafted tracts, carrying wild trains of thought all the way to the end of the line.

Each Essay takes on novelists, poets, philosophers, clergy and so-forth, mostly well-known in his day, introducing some of their work and what they stand for. If Loren Eiseley once re-introduced the symbolic essay to English in the 60's as Annie Dillard once opined in Best American Essays, Chesterton's essays each center on an idea he associates with each person. Three names I recall off-hand are Kipling, Shaw and Wells. The idea associated with Kipling is that he embodies the globe-trotter (what we called a jet-setter in the 60's) as opposed to the farmer who stays put. The world traveler thinking to enlarge his vision, becomes jaded and mentally blinkered as the world ""shrinks"" due to the greater speed of travel, while the humble man who never goes out the gate imagines a boundless world and enjoys a blessed life of enchantment. As I paraphrase the argument, it sounds trite, but it, and many others in the book are phrased so well, one can read the essays many times without sharing the fate of the traveler.

Please note, my five stars are for the book itself. I think the paperback's cover makes it look like a cheap Christian tract rather than the masterpiece of a subtle man of faith which provides food for thought as fresh today as on the day Chesterton wrote it. I include quotes from Heretics in half a dozen of my books in English and think he may seem less dated than I will in a hundred more years! G.K. Chesterton wrote HERETICS c. 1905. Yet this book is still timely in that popular gurus change opinions and social theories very quickly never realizing how dated the newest fad becomes. Chesterton had the rare ability in exposing many new fads as actually some varient of some ideas that were in vogue during Ancient History.

Chesterton never engages in ad hominem arguments. He is careful to metion the merits of those with whom he disagrees. Chesteron focuses on the logical fallacies of his critics and never engages in bitterness or smear tactics.

Readers should carefully read Chesterton's cirticisms of G.B. Shaw. Chesterton asserts the validity of Shaw's Socialism. Chesterton does not argue with Shaw's socialist views per se. He does critisize Shaw's tendenacy toward a mechanical view of society and politics. One should note that in spite of their repeated debates and crticisms of each others' work, Chesterton and Shaw remained life long friends.

Chesterton has some interesting comments on political power. Chesteron was probably not a democrat, and his views beginning on page 168 are note worthy. Chesterton remarks condemns those who pick a Caesar. He remarks that people falsely look favorably on such an individual because he, the Strong Man or the Caesar, is not an ordinary man. In other words, men may domocratically opt for someone whom ordinary think is better. This is a form despotism or slavery where the ruler has the sanctions of the victim. Other rulers hold position by heredity right whereby men accept this notion only because of the social order rather than false praise or respect for someone who may be evil and take advantage of men's sychophantic blind obedience to self appointed knaves.

Chesterton has good insight regarding the abuse of language and different rules for social classes. If some poor soul is arrested for stealing, he/she is accused of theft. If some who is wealthy is arrested for the same crime, the comment is that the wealthy person has an illness called kleptomania. To paraphrase Chesterton, the wealthy want to make laws ( or in their case excuses)while decent people want to obey the law and expect everyone to do the same.

G.K. Chesterton writes well and uses reason as his guide. He did not get angry when his critics attacked him for his personal appearance. He was a large man. Chesterton could laugh at himself. However, he got angry when men attacted honesty and truth. Chesterton was a champion of himself or his work. He was a champion of reason, truth, and honesty. Whether one disagrees with him, Chesterton is well worth reading for his prose, knowledge, and logic. I am not sure that anyone just stumbles upon Chesterton. You’ve come looking for him because you have heard someone make a reference to him, or someone has quoted one of his brilliant quotations. This is where I decided to start reading Chesterton.
“Heretics” is a collection of 20 essays, gleaned from Chesterton’s newspaper columns. As a columnist, Chesterton was perhaps akin to Molly Ivins or Mike Royko from our recent past. Since they were newspaper columns, each essay reads in about 20 to 40 minutes. Some of the writing is a bit choppy in spots, where the line of thought is not completely developed. This is why I gave it only 4 stars. This may be understandable given that these were columns with a limited amount of space.
Some of the reviewers have complained of the obscurity of many of the people who are referenced in the book, noting the subject matter as being too local, and from a time too far away. The beauty of the Kindle edition is that all you need to do is touch the name or word on the screen of the Kindle, and in many cases, up pops a link to a Wikipedia page. In this way you can get an adequate background in turn-of-the 20th-Century London. You might look at this as 2 adventures in 1.
A number of the subjects of the essays are men whom we only remember for their lasting works of literature or art. Chesterton analyzes the views of these early skeptics and free thinkers, in some cases pointing out the fallacies of their assumptions, in others the inconsistencies of their views, or in other cases illustrating the unstated consequences of the underlying philosophy.
What I really find interesting is that Chesterton maintained a friendship with George Bernard Shaw, who is the subject in a number of the essays. The respect and goodwill they displayed 100 years ago is a stark contrast to the snarkiness and name calling that passes for debate today. falsches buch eingebunden das ist so unfassbar.
wie kann sowas sein?! das habe ich noch nie erlebt.
auf keinen fall bestellen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Il testo acquistato per un regalo è stato molto apprezzato. Sicuramente un autore da scoprire. Profound, well thought, well written, prophetic in many ways that I think Chesterton himself probably didn't predict. Worth every minute. I've read multiple of G.K Chesteron's works, and while the content is always thought-provoking, often the formats are rather strange. The trim size is rather large, and the text very small. Other than that, the essays within are great for anyone who wants to get a deeper appreciation for Chesterton's ideas and their place within the broader culture and figures of his time. Chesterton is a particularly insightful and witty writer, and fully winsome in the good and proper sense of that word (unlike the TGC ilk who constantly want to co opt that word for their own purposes). He doesn’t mince words, he’s not afraid to call something out as heretical, or in other words, flat out wrong, and he’s not afraid to actually put his money where his words are and back his claim up.
But there is a jolly, jubilant, joyful nature to him, he is happy, he is not incensed, well they are to call him the joyful fighter, and he knows very well the truth that more often than not, a heart is won before a head is won, and we must win people’s hearts to the beauty and glory and goodness of our opinion before they see the rightness of it (in fact it’s beauty is its rightness).
Now this doesn’t mean that Chesterton is right on every matter in this book, indeed I think he is quite wrong on certain matters, being a Catholic, but being generally of the Christian worldview, he is imminently right about many many things, the vast majority of what he writes about even. And much like every able-minded Christian owes it to himself to read C. S Lewis and Will be much the better for it, understanding more about the world and man as a whole, despite C.S Lewis serious theological deficiencies, every Christian worth his salt, particularly the Protestants, owe it to themselves (and everyone else) to read and wrestle with, fight with, learn from, agree with, interact, and vehemently disagree with Chesterton, he will make you a better man, a better pastor, a better friend, a better thinker, even if you do agree with him in all places…particularly when you do not agree with him in all places.
What he will definitely do is help you understand the world as it actually is better, and how all the heretics out there sommaire there novel ideas are distorting our image of how the world is."
Confessions (AmazonClassics Edition),"In Confessions, regarded as the first true Western autobiography, Saint Augustine of Hippo lays bare his heart, body, and soul. In this unguarded prayer, a fallible Augustine admits to the indiscretions, selfishness, and licentious obsessions of his youth. He reveals a man of contradictory desires and beliefs, a regretful libertine torn between sin and morality on a spiritual journey toward his conversion to Christianity.
Meditative and philosophical, personal yet universal, Confessions has a surprising modernity—nearly sixteen hundred years after it was written—and still resonates, influencing and shaping our discourse on living a life filled with meaning.
Revised edition: Previously published as Confessions, this edition of Confessions (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Confession, it is said, is good for the soul; and the ""Confessions"" of Saint Augustine of Hippo are good for any person’s soul, regardless of his or her religious or philosophical beliefs. There is something profoundly compelling in the rigorous, uncompromising manner in which Augustine describes the way he consciously, by an ongoing act of will, worked to bring his magnificent intellect into conformity with the dictates of Christianity – and gave God all the credit for the outcome.

Some scholars have referred to the ""Confessions"" as the first true autobiography, or at least the first spiritual autobiography; and as with other masterpieces of autobiography in later years – Richard Wright’s ""American Hunger,"" Annie Dillard’s ""An American Childhood,"" the autobiographies of Benjamin Franklin and Malcolm X – Augustine’s ""Confessions"" benefits from the author’s unflinching, warts-and-all portrayal of his life.

Among its other benefits, the ""Confessions"" does much to put one back in the time of the Roman Empire’s early Christian years – a time when Western Christianity grappled with a great many other strains of thought. Augustine is frank, for example, in setting forth what he once found seductive about Manichaean philosophy, with its belief that, because evil is so different from good, it had to be the subject of a completely different creation, the work of some being other and lesser than God Himself:

“Since I still had enough reverence, of some sort, to make it impossible for me to believe that the good God created an evil nature, I posited two masses at odds with each other, both infinite, the bad with limited, the good with broader scope. From this pestiferous origin there followed other blasphemies. If my mind tried to recur to the Catholic faith, I was made to recoil, since the Catholic faith was not what I made it out to be” (pp. 100-01).

Here, as elsewhere, I thought that Augustine was being awfully hard on himself; but his conclusions follow logically from his premises. Evil actions proceed from the imperfections of human nature as stained by original sin. For good actions, the glory belongs to God, who is all good and inspires all good action.

Augustine is comparably unsparing in condemning himself for the sinful ways of his youth. A chapter on the theft of pears, written perhaps with an eye toward Adam and Eve’s own theft of fruit from the tree of knowledge in Chapter 3 of Genesis, becomes for Augustine a parable for the nature of sin generally; the fruit of the pear tree was “not enticing either in appearance or in taste”, but Augustine and his friends continued to steal, because “Simply what was not allowed allured us” (p. 32). Augustine is comparably tough on himself when it comes to sexual behavior – though he admits that his sins did not go as far as those of his fellows. Moreover, a large part of his sexual life seems to have involved a long-term, monogamous, mutually faithful relationship with a woman who eventually bore Augustine a son. This is not exactly fleshpots-of-Egypt stuff; but nonetheless, Augustine looks back at this part of his life in terms of how it took him away from God.

Augustine, who loves God so, nonetheless reserves some of his fondest words of love for his mother Monnica – a devout Christian who never gave up hope while encouraging her son to leave his secular ways and embrace the Christian faith: “Her flesh brought me forth to live in this daylight, as her heart brought me forth to live in eternal light” (p. 196). That process of conversion involved Augustine going from North Africa to Milan, making friends with fellow converts, and eventually receiving baptism and holy orders; and his early training as a rhetorician (he praises Cicero’s ""Hortensius"" as a book that “changed my life”) made him a most eloquent, tenacious defender of the Christian faith.

Along with describing the process by which he became a Christian – much of it in the second person, addressing God directly – Augustine of Hippo includes some thoughtful theological reflections of the kind that he would eventually build upon further in ""The City of God."" Readers who enjoy close reading and exegesis of Scriptural passages will enjoy those passages of the Confessions in which Augustine looks at the opening passages of Genesis, speculating on the manner in which time came out of God’s timeless eternity, and working to reconcile seeming paradoxes in Genesis regarding references to God alternately in the singular and the plural. Augustine reconciles that seeming contradiction thus:

“For you make [humankind] capable of understanding the Trinity of your unity and the unity of your Trinity, from its being said in the plural ‘Let us make,’ followed by the singular ‘and God made man,’ and from its being said in the plural ‘to our pattern,’ followed by the singular ‘to God’s pattern.’” (pp. 337-38)

This edition of the ""Confessions"" of Saint Augustine is noteworthy in that it was translated by the noted scholar and author Garry Wills, a renowned classicist and devout Catholic who nonetheless has been willing to criticize his beloved church whenever he has felt that, as a human institution, it has erred in its mission of bringing humankind closer to God. Wills also provides a perceptive and helpful introduction, though I can’t help thinking that footnotes of the kind that grace other Penguin Classics books might have helped further.

By the time Augustine wrote the ""Confessions,"" between 397 and 400 A.D., Christianity had already been made the official religion of the Roman Empire, in accordance with the emperor Theodosius I’s promulgation of the Edict of Thessalonica in 380 A.D. Yet it was still a world in which believers in Christian and pre-Christian religions competed for adherents, proselytes, converts. No one of his time worked on behalf of, or defended, the Christian faith with greater consistency or strength of heart than Saint Augustine of Hippo. His ""Confessions"" are inspiring, for that reason alone, to anyone who has ever cared enough about an idea to fight for it. An incredibly great read in my opinion, especially for a free public domain book. One of the greatest books that discusses the Glory of God upon the human condition in such a enlightening and reasonable manner. I really enjoyed the book not only because of the incredible philosophical reasoning St. Augustine exercises in his examples, but because the ""confessions"" narrative of how he came to be from what what he was; really resonated with me as something I could relate to. I suggest anyone going through spiritual dryness or who is lost to read this book, and if not for spiritual/religious sake, the sake of his incredible philosophical perspective. It really amazed me of the wisdom St. Augustine had in his day.

I read this on the Kindle App on my phone of course which was really handy when I was on the go.

DISCLAIMER: This version does contain a lot of archaic language. Example: ""thither, hither, dost, thou, giveth, thence, thee."" etc. And other fully archaic nouns, verbs, and adjectives. BUT All you have to do if you have the Kindle App is download the dictionary from the app itself and you can finally understand what those words mean (highlight the word only and you'll be prompted to download the dictionary) . I definitely learned a lot reading this book. I hope you do too. I am surprised that the reviews here appear to be for another edition, particularly an English translation.
This is not an English translation!!! This is the Latin text of books 1-4 of Confessions, with some notes and commentary.
What kept me from giving this 5 stars is the text reflects classical orthography, ""u"" in place of ""v"" and other things. In the 4th century the spoken language had already changed to reflect what today is often called ""ecclesiastical pronunciation"" or more correctly, ""later latin pronunciation"". If one is good with classical orthography it is not too much of a challenge, nevertheless it is not accurate to how Augustine would have spoken in the 4th century AD.
Apart from that, the text is very readable and the notes are very helpful in breaking down complex constructions that Augustine uses as well as explaining obscure vocabula. This is great to fill in a gap for Latin students, namely moving from classical Latin to ecclesiastical writers. Augustine's Latin is very important for reading medieval and scholastic Latin, since apart from the Vulgate, Augustine is the writer, more than any other, around whom later writers would base their composition and style. Augustine is the last gasp of major intellectual thought in the Roman Empire, and his rhetoric and argument is as strong for us today as it was in his own day.
There are a few drawbacks, depending on one's level of Latin. There is no facing vocabulary or a vocabulary in the back, which is not a handicap for someone who knows Latin well but can be for an intermediate student looking to move to better reading fluency. The pain of having to look up certain words can affect the enjoyment of the work, but on the other hand the student should be doing/already have done this work. For an instructor it merely creates the headache of having to make a worksheet or emphasize vocabulary based on what kind of instruction the student has received in the past. My attitude to facing vocabulary is that it is basically like training wheels and may even make the student lazy rather than force him to appropriate necessary vocabulary. Be that as it may, another shortcoming is the fact that the notes are not next to the text but are in the back. This means that you have to keep your finger in two places, or after reading a bit you must flip to the back for certain explanations which interrupts the flow of the reading, rather than glancing quickly to the next page before continuing. Again, for someone at an advanced or instructional level, this is not so difficult, but again, for an intermediate student it can become a handicap.

On the whole, however, this text is very good for filling the gap of reading early and medieval Church Latin. The primacy on classics is unfortunate given that Latin continued as a language for 2 thousand years after the age of Augustus, and a lot of texts and instruction would leave one at a loss to read for example, legal Latin of the middle ages and early modern period, theological Latin whether of the Church Fathers or medieval scholastic theologians, or early Latin writings of protestant writers like Calvin and Luther, etc. Given that at the least 1/3rd of those studying Latin are doing so out of an interest in the tradition of the Latin Church, this is a major gap that eventually needs to be filled. This is the first book on religion I have ever read from cover to cover. I cannot compare it literally to anything I have read, because of my academic background. The wording is extremely different, and comes across as clearly understandable. Although, it is probably unfair to compare a book on religion to a book on education. Highly recommended reading for any Catholic or non-Catholic person. Received the product damaged. The first page was torn in half, there were dusty handprint marks on the cover with dirt/mud, and the condition was really bad. vary niss Enriching What is there to say about the Confessions of St. Augustine? A classic... and awesome... Many of the lessons, experiences, questions, challenges and arguments that he went through are still prevalent today..."
The Secret of Chimneys (AmazonClassics Edition),"Cash-strapped drifter Anthony Cade agrees to two jobs at the behest of an old friend. He is to deliver an unpublished memoir to a publisher and return a cache of letters to a woman. The simple errands soon plunge Cade into dangerous international intrigue that draws together Scotland Yard, the French Sûreté, and the heir to the Herzoslovakian throne. But it’s at the historic estate of Chimneys in the English countryside that the dark secrets of a treacherous conspiracy erupt in murder.
Clandestine societies, ciphers, hidden passages, body doubles, and questionable detectives are just part of a deviously clever puzzle—part mystery, part treasure hunt—devised by the unparalleled Agatha Christie. First published in 1925, The Secret of Chimneys marked the debut of Superintendent Battle—the stolid investigator who appeared in five classic Christie mysteries.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Secret of Chimneys, this edition of The Secret of Chimneys (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. My whole obsession with English mysteries started with Agatha Christie. 'The Man in the Brown Suit ' was my very first mystery. I was 12 years old and am now in my 50's. I reread these mysteries again and again. When good-natured adventurer Anthony Cade accepts two commissions from his friend Jimmy McGrath, he little realizes that the simple delivery jobs will throw him into a web of international intrigue and danger. His first task is to deliver the recently deceased Herzoslovakian Count Stylpitch's memoirs to his London publisher - a manuscript whose secrets warring political factions will do anything to prevent being published. Anthony's second task is to return a package of indiscreet love letters to one Virginia Revel. From the moment he returns to England his every movie is shadowed, and when the letters are stolen and the thief turns up murdered in Virginia's home, he discovers a surprising connection between the Count's secrets and the scandalous letters, with the thread tying them together being the famed Chimneys estate. Political alliances are formed and careers made within Chimney's famous - and scandal-ridden - walls. As the players in the Herzoslovakian business gather, Anthony finds himself in a race against time to catch a killer, unmask a thief, and determine his future.

I was first introduced to Agatha Christie through her most famous sleuths, Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple. It's only in recent years that I've delved into her standalone fiction, and now The Secret of Chimneys has rocketed to the top of my favorites list. It's a dizzingly fast-paced read, chock-full of enough of Christie's trademark plot twists and turns to give the reader whiplash. The political intrigue-saturated storyline is reminscent of a Hitchcock film, but it's the characters that set this little gem apart. Anthony Cade is an absolutely delightful hero - self-assured, intelligent, snarky, and humorously irreverent, Christie had me in stitches with his every scene. The country house setting provides a nicely isolated setting for Christie to examine a microcosmic slice of early twentieth-century English stereotypes - the devlishly smart amateur investigator, the glittering socialite, the unflappable inspector, and the long-suffering, eccentric British nobleman - all are forced to confront secrets, lies, and threats within the walls of Chimneys.

The Secret of Chimneys requires a healthy suspension of disbelief as the royal intrigue aspect of the storyline is a bit more far-fetched than some of Christie's other country house-set mysteries. However, the red herrings and dizzying plot twists, combined with intelligent, appealing leads, a well-drawn, humorous supporting cast of characters, and sparkling dialogue make Chimneys one of Christie's most delightful, entertaining standalone mysteries. This is absolutely the best non-Poirot book Agatha Christie ever wrote, and certainly ranks up there with the best of the Poirot ones as well. It's certainly very different from typical murder mysteries, despite having many of the cliched elements. The delight in this book is the characters and they way they interact. You'll come away with a new appreciation of Battle, if you've only seen him on the sidelines to Poirot before. All the other other characters are wonderful as well, and part of the fun is that nearly everyone in the book is playing their cards close to their chest, but Christie does a wonderful job of revealing enough, but never too much. There is a lot going on in this book, and it is not to be rushed through. However, this is one of the very few books that I read a second time, and it was enjoyable as the first time, having, as it were, a different perspective on the characters and the plot. I've re-read a few more times now, just to enjoy the dialog and amusing touches throughout the book. Highly recommended. A great read. Christie's stories never disappoint. But ""A Hercule Poirot Mystery"" as advertised on the cover? No such character in this book. No publisher's information. I was under the impression all of Christie's writings were under copyright? Classic early Christie. Feels a bit dated, but, after all, it was written a hundred years ago. It's held up just fine. I loved it! What fun. You don’t know who is who until til the end! I didn’t realize Agatha Christie wrote a comedy. Yes, it is a murder mystery, but the best part is trying to figure out who is who! I had never read an Inspector Battles novel..I love A.C…this novel was so much fun..adventure, intrigue, and love.. the layers that are subtly revealed..best ever! Now for the next Battles!! Flexibound cover and page quality are consistent with other word cloud classic productions (very good, though the cover can become easily damaged especially in shipping) This book demonstrates the art of filling out a plot in interesting and humorous ways. So very many of the new writers fill their stories with incredibly boring and pedestrian padding such as the colour of a room and/or its furniture that only warrants skipping over. I was reading one book that described how the mc leant against a chain link fence and put his fingers through the gaps etc, etc. really? I dnf that one. Anyway I did enjoy this, a good mixture of dastardly deeds and sparkling wine. Agatha Christie is once more as engrossing as in the '30s. I was interested in reading this because of the Miss Marple Series which included this title. The Marple movie was absolutely outstanding, and my favorite of all the Marple series, but nothing like the book. In fact, Miss Marple was not in this book at all. If you enjoyed the Miss Marple series from Masterpiece Theater, you must read this book. In fact, it was so detailed that the MP Theater version was really about as complicated as one would want. It took several days for me to finish the book because I had to absorb all the murders and characters. Another whodunit that made Agatha Christie the most valued mystery writer of her time. Excellent story. It is a part of the series on Superintendent Battle. Enjoyed it till the end!
I would recommend this book. Avvincente Considering it was written nearly 100 years ago, it is a very good read. It was one of Agatha Christie's very early books. Apart from the mystery, it is an interesting insight into the world of women at that time, life among the upper echelons of England and the persons they depended upon to support their lifestyle."
Ethan Frome (AmazonClassics Edition),"In the dead gray cold of Starkfield, Massachusetts, farmer Ethan Frome is struggling to scrape out a living. His duties are to his wife, Zeena—an ungrateful, soul-sick hypochondriac as frigid as the New England winter. When Zeena’s cousin Mattie arrives to help with the farm, the ethereal, gentle-natured beauty brings a light and a fugitive affection into Ethan’s life. Yet for Ethan and Mattie, daring to be happy—and together—will have its consequences.
Exploring the costs of living life according to social mores, Edith Wharton’s Ethan Frome is a masterwork of doomed love.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Ethan Frome, this edition of Ethan Frome (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Although a thoroughly well written and nostalgic book, the story is depressing to the uttermost. The story of a triangular love has the most ironic of endings with many unexpected and sad moments along the way. I tell my students that they need a sharp razor blade when reading the book, so that when the depression overwhelms them, they will not make a jagged cut.

Perhaps the author is giving us a glimpse into her own ultimately failed marriage as she records the quest of love by the protagonist who is married to a shrew who is a bitter woman. His awkwardness and slowness to speak to his desire adds to the suspense and to the eventual loss of opportunity.

This is a frame story, with a narrator who begins and ends the tale, being a traveler who inquires of the strange man he encountered, the one with the strange, deformed limp.

The reader will not so much ENJOY this novel as they will come to APPRECIATE its art. Edith Wharton is a master story teller, but have a DVD of a very funny comedy available to cheer you up when you finish this short novel. What I loved about this book was the beautiful writing. The descriptions make you feel like you are there in the village. The story of Ethan and two women in his life is heartbreaking. The end was surprising. I thoroughly enjoy reading this novel. It is one of the few that I have read more than once. It is short, but it is dynamic. One can read it in an afternoon. The main character is such a pitiful ruin of a man. He had so much potential, but was trapped by family obligations and his strong sense of duty to a dying farm and a cold, unfeeling wife. His last chance for love is destroyed when his selfish, bitter wife decides out of jealousy and revenge to send Ethan's true love away. The lovers decide to die together and even that plan goes awry when the sled they are on does not hit the target properly. The outcome is devastating and heartbreaking. Ethan is even more trapped after the accident and his lover becomes worse than his wife ever was. This story is wonderfully written. It is a story within a story and is a must read for anyone. One can not help but get lost in Ms. Wharton's sad tale. Perhaps this particular story is a bit autobiographical if one chooses to read about Ms. Wharton's life. She, too, lost at love. Look for lots of symbolism in the setting and in her descriptions. Clear, concise character study. Story line a little choppy, but comes together. Well written, truly a classic. A Wharton fan. very dark and slow..... I first heard about Ethan Frome when reading the Divine Feud: a biography of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Apparently, Bette Davis spent a lifetime trying to get the story filmed. So I bought Ethan Frome and read it. It is a novella written by Edith Wharton. Some say that the story was loosely based on her own personal relationships at the time. Whatever the genesis of the story, it is haunting. It stayed with me for a few days. Wharton creates a strong atmosphere, vivid characters and a sense of doom. There are many themes in the story I think: the overwhelming one for me is the hopelessness of the very poor and the tyranny of fate. Fate however can of course be the result of many decisions made along the way, those decisions which lead to hoplessness are the ones which should truly be lamented. A novel written at the beginning of last century about a man seen every day in town, looking defeated, discouraged, and with no zest for life. Nobody wants to talk about him, and only mention is made that his life is a tragedy. Finally, facts unfold and we discover that Ethan was married to a dominating woman, Zeeda, and fell in love with Mattie, a relative of Zeeda's who went to live with them to help her because ""she could do nothing"". The decisions made by each of these 3 characters will play a significant role in this tragedy. It is a tragic romantic story, and although it is so depressing, I enjoyed it because it is very well written. I bought this book for a selection our book club is reading this month. I could have bought other editions, and even downloaded one for free, but I really appreciate how OWC editions are published. The timelines are excellent, as are the notes and introductions. As for the book itself, I really liked its structure, from an interesting prologue to a surprising epilogue. Please do not first read these two chapters of the novella, because Wharton's development of the story really takes the reader in and makes the surprise at the end very gripping. Despite being a very sad book, I found it to be very well written. Une histoire d'amour tragique comme il en existe. I've been loving the Penguin English Library editions.. because they're floppy paperbacks ( so no fear of cracking the spine) with really cute covers. And I've been waiting to buy Ethan Frome in this edition and finally ordered it when the price came down. The book was in great condition, no damages at all and it was delivered on time. イーディス･ウォートンというと、19世紀後半、20世紀前半のニュー･ヨークにおいてまだ「上流階級」などとくくって呼ばれる社会について著した『エイジ･オブ･イノセンス』、『歓楽の家』や『カスタム･オブ･ザ･カントリー』などが有名である。
本著の舞台は冬のマセチューセッツの田舎。農業を営む寡黙の老人、イーサン･フロームについての比較的短い話である。建築関係の仕事上静かな農村にやってきた語り手がホーソーンの『緋文字』と同様のスタイルでイーサン･フロームの過去を推測を交えて描いてゆくものだ。
舞台も登場人物の階級もいつものウォートンとは異なっているので少々驚かれる方もいらっしゃるかもしれない。しかし、ウォートンの全作品に見られる育ちやそれに伴う運命に必死で立ち向かいながらも最終的には完全に打ち勝つことができない過程が非常によく出ている。やはり作者は場所を移しても変わらないものだなと思う。
アメリカの高校で大半のアメリカ人が読むこの作品、もしよろしければ、「暑いイーサン」と呼ばれる『サマー』と併せてお読みください。 I first read this years ago and the character and aura of the book has been part of my life. Reading it again reminds me how astute, insightful and brilliant Edith Wharton is. A joy! Una hermosa novela. Vale la pena leerla."
Walden (AmazonClassics Edition),"At Walden Pond, Henry David Thoreau reflected on simpler living in the natural world. By removing himself from the distractions of materialism, Thoreau hoped to not only improve his spiritual life but also gain a better understanding of society through solitary introspection.
In Walden, Thoreau condenses his two-year, two-month, two-day stay into a single year, using the four seasons to symbolize human development—a cycle of life shared by both nature and man. A celebration of personal renewal through self-reliance, independence, and simplicity, composed for all of us living in “quiet desperation,” Walden is eternal.
Revised edition: Previously published as Walden, this edition of Walden (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. And `Tis a shame that I cannot claim this is a re-read after 40 years or so. I can only cite the very well-worn cliché: Better late than never.

Walden is a pond, just outside Concord, Massachusetts, and for two years in the mid-1840's Henry David Thoreau lived a largely solitary existence there, in a simple wooden cabin which he constructed. This book is a collection of his mediations on the natural world, and a person's place in it. Thoreau also ruminates on an individual's place in society and certainly demurs about the hurly-burly existence led by so many, or, in an expression that I had always attributed to T. S. Eliot, but was first coined by him: ""the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.""

The first third of the book is on ""economy,"" and the house that he built near Walden. He describes his labor, and provides a table indicating the total cost, and compares that with the annual rental cost of housing. Similarly, he covers his food, clothing and fuel expenses (the ""essentials""), and the underlying theme remains the subject verse, taken from a Shaker song, ""Simple Gifts,"" written about the same time: if you simplify your life, and rid yourself of the bondage of so much self-imposed clutter, you really are much freer, and that includes having the opportunity to take a ramble in the woods, which was a major aspect of his two years at Walden. As Thoreau phrased it: ""Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them."" Or in another passage: ""I also have in my mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters."" Contrast that with the constant exhortations of our consumer society to ""buy, buy, buy"" and if we can only get the American consumer spending again, our ""economy"" will be OK. The beauty of Thoreau is an independent mind writing against the grain of conventional thought.

Much of the latter portion of the book features his observation and outlook on the natural world around him. These observations range from the scientific to the poetic, with an emphasis on the latter, but he does not hesitate to make controlled measurements, like determining the true depth of the pond, which had previously been the subject of speculation. He describes how ice is harvested from the pond, and shipped to Boston for summer use, and is continually intrigued by the color of both the ice and the water in the pond. For those who are overwhelmed with ""light pollution"" and do not know what the phase of the moon is, Thoreau provides a suitable admonition: ""It would be well, perhaps, if we were to spend more of our days and nights without any obstruction between us and the celestial bodies, if the poet did not speak so much from under a roof, or the saint dwell there so long. Birds do not sing in caves, nor do doves cherish their innocence in dovecots.""

There is much else as well. He describes the life of poverty of his nearest neighbor, an Irish family who are recent immigrants. He also observes a battle between red and black ants, and plays ""hide and go seek"" with a loon on the lake. He leans towards vegetarianism, but praises hunting, and considers it a vital rite of passage for any boy (and yes, it was so long ago, the other half were not even considered).

Walden is not an easy read. In part it is due to the turgidity of Thoreau's prose style. There is also the aspect that portions of the book resemble the Desiderata poem that was plastered to so many bedroom walls in the 60's: a string of exhortation on the proper way to conduct one's life. The meaning of some of these aphorisms are quite understandable, for example: ""While England endeavors to cure the potato-rot, will not any endeavor to cure the brain-rot, which prevails so much more widely and fatally""? But it would take some true assumptions and extrapolations, and they could be quite divergent, to squeeze the meaning from: ""The volatile truth of our words should continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement. Their truth is instantly translated; its literal monument alone remains. The words which express our faith and piety are not definite; yet they are significant and fragrant like frankincense to superior natures."" I'd welcome reader comments as to what that really means.

Walden was hardly a ""commercial success"" in Thoreau's lifetime, but its impact on numerous historical figures was significant. He was admired by the naturalists John Muir, Joseph Wood Krutch, Loren Eiseley, and David Brower. His companion volume, (On Civil Disobedience) influenced Tolstoy, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, as well as many others.

It is a book to be read slowly, with some tolerance for his style, and the occasional still quirky observations. Walden remains a 5-star read, and is an essential book for everyone to read, at least once in their life, even if it is in the latter phases.

Finally, proving that once again there are those unlikely connections that add the zest to life: each day I look 70 miles to the west, and enjoy the view of the mountain most commonly called Mt. Taylor, named after Zachary Taylor, the President of the United States who started the Mexican-American War, and is the reason this piece of earth that I inhabit is part of the USA. Henry David Thoreau practiced civil disobedience, and was briefly jailed for his failure to pay his taxes as a protest against that war. First things first: if you are reading this review, it is probably because you are considering not just Walden, but Walden on audio. Does it work in that medium?

Have no fear: not only does Walden not LOSE something by being read, it probably gains something from Mel Foster's excellent performance. My first experience with his reading was the production of William Bernstein's A Splendid Exchange, and it was disappointing -- flat and lifeless. But he did a fine job with James Kugel's How to Read the Bible: A Guide to Scripture, Then and Now, and this is terrific, too; I'll assume the mediocre job with the Bernstein was the producer's fault.

Now, to the book. So much has been written about it, both on Amazon and elsewhere, that there is little more to say. But I will say this: if you read it in college, or if, like me, you merely PRETENDED to read it in college, pick it up again later in life. It is worth reading, and studying, and savoring.

Walden is thought of as the urtext of nature writing, particularly American nature writing, but that really understates the matter -- thus, my assessment of it as an ""underrated"" classic. It is really so much more: an essay on the nature and purpose of human existence, an exploration of human nature itself, and an example of how we can see the sacred in the mundane. Indeed, one could argue that Thoreau was not so much writing about nature, but using nature as a way of seeing the supernatural -- looking THROUGH nature to grasp the reality of the unseen.

And forget any notion you may have had about Thoreau, the dreamer: this is actually a very practical man, who strives hard to show that what he is doing can be a model for what all people should do. Not that they should go live in a cabin, but rather that they can and should seek their own unique path of existence. (Thus, the different drummer). It is no accident that the first and longest chapter is entitled ""Economy"": Thoreau wants to demonstrate that following a different IS possible if we prepare ourselves. If he is not fully convincing that anyone can do anything they want and make it stick, he is, in my view, unanswerable in his assertion that we cannot and must not be satisfied with what we are given, or what tradition or even our own habits tell us what we ""should"" do. If for nothing else, Walden is must-reading for anyone, young or old, religious or atheist, American or citizen of any nation. Or even no nation. Thoreau’s Walden is a timeless masterpiece—thoughtful and filled with wisdom about self-sufficiency and the beauty of nature. However, this edition comes with a challenge: the font is tiny. So tiny, in fact, that I often found myself getting lost mid-paragraph. If you’re planning to enjoy this classic, do yourself a favor—grab a magnifying glass (or prepare for some serious eye strain). Five stars for the content, but minus one for the microscopic text! 人生に悩みはつきものです。

A Tale of Two Cities (AmazonClassics Edition),"Charles Darnay is a French noble falsely accused of treason. Sydney Carton is a self-loathing junior barrister enlisted to defend him. Between them is a shared love for the daughter of a former Bastille prisoner. Soon, their interlocking fates will be decided, as the French Revolution is ignited and the Reign of Terror begins.
Charles Dickens’s belief in renaissance is borne out in this epic novel—as cities are overthrown and transformed, as cynics become selfless heroes, and as a “recall to life” becomes not only possible but necessary, for the individual and for society.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds. As a high school curriculum, my teacher required my class to read A Tale of Two Cities. This book caught my attention starting from the opening sentence ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times"" and kept me equally engaged till the last sentence ""It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."" Although, in the beginning, I found the book's language challenging that required me to read some passages more than once to draw essence, but after few chapters I fell in love with the book. This book contains multiple heart throbbing events that left me awestruck, such as the tragic peasants' sufferings, fierce mob scenes; brutality at guillotine etc. Dickens infuses the story with a variety of emotions, ranging from love to hatred, sacrifice to selfishness, kindness to brutality, nurturing to killing, joy to tragedy, generosity to greed, as well as romance and suspense. Dickens fully makes use of several literary devices, such as allusions and imageries to embellish the script. Not only that I enjoyed the book's fictitious story, but also the book enhanced my knowledge of the history related to French Revolution and England. In the book, Dickens exhibits the social and political condition of 18th century England and France; the story of A Tale of Two Cities takes place in two major cities of these countries, London and Paris. In particular, Sydney Carton, the most complex and dynamic character of the novel, touched me the most. He emerges from a weak and sensual character, initially described as a ""man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away"" to a powerful character capable of making the ultimate sacrifice by giving up his life for the woman he loves. Dickens' illustration of Carton's death scene; his recital of the words ""I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die, ""and the words ""Twenty-three"" impact me the most, causing me to shed few tears. The book possesses many other attractions such as duality of characters. Specifically, the duality of Lucie Manette and Madame Defarge permeates throughout the novel. Dickens portrays Lucie as a nurturing character who ""ever busily [winds] the golden thread that bound them all together, weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their lives."" In contrast, Dickens describes Madame Defarge as a ""ruthless woman, a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense"" who ""was absolutely without pity."" A Tale of Two Cities provides both education and entertainment; I highly recommend this book to any avid reader who seeks a book filled with humor, emotions, romance, and tragedy. Having one of the most famous opening paragraphs in Literature notwithstanding, this long tale stands on three solid pillars… along with a whole host of decorative posts. Pillar one is the historical detail, accurate to the very last aristocraticly-cruel glare over laced collar. The strong, ever-moving plot follows and stitches the bits of London and Paris history together into a finely woven story, one that echoes long-forgotten epic ballads, though in true literary form.

The last pillar is the drama, not overly done, not poured so fast that the plot drowns as a spindly seedling in a lake... but patiently unfolding. Dickens caught up fistfuls of the rampant emotion present during that tumultuous time, hearkening forth the bloodcurdling bawls of long-maligned peasants whipped into a frenzy by the madness of mob rule. This review will not reveal all but merely attempt to incite curiosity in readers to entrench themselves in this classic book.

It is difficult to remember throughout this story that this is indeed a ’Dickens’ book… an author known for his rather hopeful stories, whose plots tend to lean heavily on the milk of human kindness. Though Dickens excelled in painting humans as they are with his pen, this tome is by far his most macabre in flavor... yet, I knew as I read it that this was due more to the actual events than to the writer, for historical accounts show that despite one or two literary straying from known paths into storytelling, this piece may have almost been a chronological account of the revolution in question.

The tale begins as most great stories do, with an innocent person suffering an enormous wrong by greedy overlords bent by decades of excess, wont to do as they please. This ‘beginning’ is gradually revealed as the plot goes along similar to now movies use flashbacks to give background filler. I digress: a young peasant girl falls victim to a particular, tyrannical aristocrat; as she is laboring to give birth to the nobleman’s illegitimate child a local doctor, Alexandre Manette, is called in to assist. Tragically, he is unable to save her or the child, and for some reason instead of merely warning the doctor into silence about the scene he’s just witnessed, the aristocrat ushered the good man into a waiting, blanketed carriage and hustles him off to the worst place in all France: the Bastille prison.

Though the man wishes to decry his chains, his name is written down in the prison ledger and he is closeted away in one of the foul, stinking cells of stone. There he remains for 18 years, not knowing how his servants or young daughter are or how to contact them. Eventually one of his former servants Defarge finds him and is allowed to care for the man. Defarge and his oddly cold wife Therese run a wine shop and secretly nurture a blossoming secret revolutionary group referred to as ‘Jacques’, a name taken from an actual French Revolution group, the Jacquerie. Therese has her own dark reasons for zealously provoking rebellion, which are revealed later in the book.

Time goes on; Dr. Manette’s daughter Lucie (a lovely, sweet-tempered girl) is cared for by the capable, motherly housekeeper; Lucie is laboring under the delusion that her father is dead. Eventually Tellson’s Bank in London gets word somehow of Manette’s real condition and in order to verify the information (the reason involved money)sends an astute and dedicated employee named Jarvis Lorry to Lucie. He explains that her father is alive and enlists her help; normally a17-year-old girl that that time would have been a traveling liability, but Lorry is clever enough to know that 18 years in the Bastille may have thrown a damper on Manette’s reasoning ability, and that seeing his daughter may slowly snap him out of it. This thinking proves correct.

Eventually the seekers find Defarge, whom leads them to a cell where a half-catatonic, wasted Manette sits, making shoes in a compulsory manner, having severely withdrawn into his own mind. Eventually, the sight of his daughter’s golden tresses stirs a small memory in his mind, and he grows to recognize her and know himself again. Lucie and Lorry liberate him and carry him back to England to convalesce in the arms of family and devoted servants. Thus ends the first third of the book, and one of the few happier moments. Two more parts lead these characters into a web of mystery, love and finally, resolve.

Notonly for readers but writers, this tome is well worth the time and energy required to read and enjoy the historical drama, well-developed characters and genteel intrigue overshadowed by the hideous wraith of revolution. Few today write as well--or as honestly--as Dickens did here. Maravilhoso, mas tem de ser lido em inglês. Review by Mary Haskett
A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens is a mesmerizing read. This timeless novel set in the time of the French revolution portrays the evil and the good in man. The French poor, spurred to anger and hatred by the injustices incurred upon them by the French aristocracy, by degrees turn into an unrelenting murderous mob as they seek justice. Many innocent victims are trundle to Madame Guillotine day after day, adults and children alike, and Madame Defarge filled with hatred for injustices done to her family sits and knits at the foot of the guillotine along with her peers, reveling as heads fall.
Across the sea in England, society is more civilized. In London, the reader meets a variety of characters, Charles Darnay, formerly Evermonde, Lucie his wife, and Lucie’s father, all have escaped from France. Charles feels compelled to return to France and rescue his overseer wrongly imprisoned. He meets the same fate. Lucie and her father set out to save him.
In the shadow of this drama is one, Sydney Carton, a heavy drinker, who strongly resembles Charles in appearance. The true character of Sydney Carton surfaces as he devises a plan to take Charles place at the guillotine. He arranges the escape of the family, with the help of good servants.
If you have never read a Tale of Two Cities, you have doubtless heard of Sydney Carton’s last words as he went to the guillotine. “It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done: it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.” He emerges at the end of this tale as a true and noble hero.

Lady Chatterley's Lover (AmazonClassics Edition),"When Constance Reid’s new husband, Sir Clifford Chatterley, returns from war paralyzed and in a wheelchair, she sees her future wither. As their marriage grows loveless, she mourns the desires fated to go unfulfilled. But a stirring fascination with Oliver Mellors, the estate’s coarse, taciturn gamekeeper, blooms into feelings she feared had died. Soon the lovers find themselves entangled in scandal, and their taboo affair becomes as pernicious as it is passionate.
Condemned when first published for its frank language and bold eroticism, this controversial landmark novel stands today as a trailblazing contribution to the literary canon.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Lady Chatterley's Lover, this edition of Lady Chatterley's Lover (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Despite the fact that it was written in the 1920's this book carried the same scandalous notoriety that Fifty Shades of Gray carries today--but in a much milder form. Growing up during that time period in the Appalachian Mountains, I couldn't quite understand why a largely undereducated group of women like my mother and my aunt laughed and whispered while they were discussing this book that they were all reading. Today, this behavior seems almost laughable. Our children and grandchildren are exposed or bombarded with a constant deluge of much more risque material on the internet and television on on a daily basis. But remember, this was the 1950's in the Bible Belt. This was pre-Playboy. This was pre-cable TV. This was pre-adult bookstores. Women stayed in a bad marriage because a divorcé was somehow labeled as undesirable company. Girls who became pregnant out of wedlock went ""to stay with Aunt Shirley"" before coming back to school a year later.

Besides appealing to the prurient interests of the naive reader, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a damned good read. The characters are so well developed that the reader cannot help but empathize with the untenable situation Lady Chatterly finds herself. She has a controlling crippled husband who is incapable of meeting either her mental or physical needs. She lives in a large unmanageable estate that she hates. She has no friends or close relatives in whom she can confide. The dusty dirty polluted coal mining community in which she finds herself does not lend itself to outdoor diversions. It seems inevitable that she would find refuge in an extramarital affair. The world would consider the lowly gamekeeper to be beneath Lady Chatterley's station in life, but Mellors is a true enigma. He is Sir Clifford's minion of the lowest sort. He speaks with the local vernacular that is almost indecipherable. He lives in in a sparsely furnished hut that offers only the most basic creature comforts. But Lady Chatterly falls in love with and into the bed of the Mellors who was well-read, who had travelled the world as a lieutenant in the King's army, who spoke impeccable English, and who could provide Lady Chatterley's psychological and physical needs.

The author has the rare ability to combine the language of both well-bred and the slum dweller. He provide a rare insight into the lives of the inhabitants of both ends of the social and economic spectrum. Lady Chatterley's Lover satisfies the reader as well as the main characters in the book. However, it leaves open a question that may be taboo even in our less inhibited modern open society--should a full-time caregiver living in an inescapable situation be given a free pass to go outside the bonds of marriage to find the physical and mental relief that is essential to the caregivers ultimate survival. At this time I guess that we will have to wait for the next author to answer that question. I was barely an adolescent when Lady Chatterley’s Lover was finally allowed to be published in the United States. It was allegedly a “dirty” book. I remember a paperback copy being furtively passed around in my middle school English class along with a whispered “page 258.” Then you would hear a gasp from whoever was reading the notorious page 258 before passing it on for the next person to gasp over. Lo, all these decades later, I’m at last reading it for real. It’s a good book. It’s about sex, but it’s also about a lot more than sex. Set in Midlands England after World War I, the novel tells the story of Lady Constance Chatterley, who is married to young Sir Clifford Chatterley, newly come home from the war dead from the waist down. He is confined to a wheelchair and he is sexually impotent. Clifford and Constance have a strong mental rapport and a loving, albeit sexless relationship. Clifford one day tells her that he wouldn’t mind if she had a child, so long as she doesn’t tell him who the father is. He wants an heir; no one has to know that his heir is not his biological offspring. At first, she is disbelieving, but gradually the idea takes hold of her. Enter Sir Clifford’s gamekeeper, a man embittered by his lack of chances in this world despite superior service in India, a hard-working attitude, and innate intellectual gifts. One day Constance accidentally catches him bathing himself and is aroused on many levels by his presence. And thus begins a very passionate love affair that thwarts all the well-made plans of everyone.

England in the early Twentieth Century was already an empire in decline and the decline was only to accelerate. In Sir Clifford, the impotent intellectual in a wheelchair, Lawrence finds the perfect metaphor for the nation’s psyche. Most of his ancient woods have been converted to factories and mines and housing developments. But he vows to hold on and revive his now depleted woods. Mellors, the newly-hired gamekeeper, is full of brooding sexuality, restless and dissatisfied as he tries to accept his lowly place in the world after the war. All the characters are prisoners of the horrid caste system, especially the headstrong and vibrant young woman. I found this a powerful novel that asks big questions. It’s fairly short and I read it fairly quickly. I found it thoroughly enjoyable and provocative on many levels. Four Stars. 灰色の雲が覆う炭鉱の街での不倫の物語。作者は不倫についた肯定も否定もせず、たんたんと物語る。 Un vrai roman d'amour, romantique et sensuel, une critique aussi de la société industrialisée er du dieu argent qui anihile les hommes, du ""cultural gap"" entre les classes et leur lutte, le tout dans une langue magnifique. A lire! Kannte den Film und die deutsche Übersetzung von Lady Chatterley und wagte mich nun ans Original. Auch wenn es oft sehr schwierig für mich war, alles zu verstehen, besonders die im Dialekt gesprochenen Szenen, habe ich es nicht bereut. Dieses Buch ist ein Klassiker. Viel zu oft verkannt als reine Erotikliteratur, schildert Lawrence sehr einfühlsam und sozialkritisch den Standesdünkel der Oberschicht, die Probleme der zunehmenden Idustrialisierung nach dem ersten Weltkrieg und last but noch least die zunehmende körperliche Frustration der liebenswerten und warmherzigen Connie an der Seite ihres gelähmten und ziemlich kalten Ehemanns Sir Clifford. Wie sie sich in den anfangs schroffen Wildhüter Mellors verliebt und bei ihm die Freuden einer erfüllenden Sexualität erfährt, erstmals Wärme und vollständige Verschmelzung mit einem anderen Menschen - das hat mich sehr gerührt.

Dass ein Mann vor fast hundert Jahren die Sicht einer Frau und die körperliche Liebe so einfühlsam schildern kann, ist bewundernswert. Leider wurde Lady Chatterley damals zu einem Skandalbuch und der Autor hat seinen Erfolg wohl nicht mehr erlebt. Schade, ich fand seine Ansichten sehr weitsichtig für die damalige Zeit, nicht nur was die Liebe betrifft. Ein sehr schöner Roman! Es war die Mühe wert, ihn im Original zu lesen. Il libro è arrivato in ottime condizioni!
Questo romanzo generò molto scalpore quando fu pubblicato per la prima volta in quanto esplora due temi poco piacevoli per l'età post-Vittoriana: la differenza di classe e l'amore, ma non l'amore puro e redentivo celebrato da Dickens, piuttosto l'amore sensuale e passionale che era tanto scandaloso all'epoca. La storia parla di Connie Chatterley, costretta a una vita isolata dalla società per via della paralisi che ha colpito il marito, sentendosi soffocare nella società che la circonda. Si sentirà di nuovo viva quando inizierà una relazione clandestina con Oliver Mellors. Una storia davvero coinvolgente e appassionante! Em 1960, foi realizado num tribunal londrino o julgamento de um dos mais polêmicos romances do século XX, ""The Lady Chatterley's Lover"", escrito por H. D. Lawrence em 1928. Absolvido da acusação de indecente e nocivo para a juventude, finalmente, o livro pode ser liberado para venda na Inglaterra, apesar de já circular em edições estrangeiras ou piratas há décadas.

Na comemoração do cinquentenário da sentença, o periódico ""The Guardian"" avaliou o episódio como ""um marco simbólico da primeira batalha moral entre as forças humanitárias liberais e um conservadorismo decadente, abrindo caminho para discussões decisivas sobre as leis do divórcio, homossexualidade, aborto, o fim da pena de morte e da censura.""

Sem dúvida, tamanha importância não se deve somente ao viés ""pornográfico"" da obra, aliás, menos polêmico desde a crescente banalização do assunto, muito menos por conta do relacionamento amoroso entre uma aristocrata casada, Lady Constance Chatterley, e um guarda-caças chamado Oliver Mellors. Sua força reside nas ideias de Lawrence sobre sexo e a procura pela completa felicidade física e psicológica. Outro ponto relevante é seu contexto histórico, ao abordar as trágicas consequências da Primeira Guerra, o declínio do Império britânico e a dificuldade da nobreza se adaptar a essa nova realidade. Curioso, é o tom trágico do protagonista que parece prever um segundo conflito mundial.

É inegável a semelhança da história com o próprio casamento de Lawrence que, debilitado pela tuberculose, fazia vista grossa às aventuras da mulher. Outro ponto que merece atenção é sua aparente pouco conhecimento sobre a sexualidade feminina.

The Prophet (AmazonClassics Edition),"Almustafa has been exiled in the island city of Orphalese for twelve years when he sees his ship coming with the mist. Before he sets sail, the beloved prophet is asked by his followers to impart his truth. In these twenty-eight poetic essays, he offers profound inspiration on such matters of love and friendship, freedom and self-knowledge, joy and sorrow, pleasure, prayer, and death. In doing so, Almustafa offers a universal serenity.
A Lebanese émigré to the United States, Kahlil Gibran wrote The Prophet to transcend the barriers between East and West and to open up new possibilities for spiritual guidance. Today it stands as one of the most beloved and translated books in history.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Prophet, this edition of The Prophet (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. It’s deep. The authors story is deep. But it does the heart good. Impressive work but much smaller and thinner than photo still 5 stars because it is jam packed with useful information I first heard about The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran from someone I met on a plane to Virginia. Over mimosas and a conversation about philosophy and life, they recommended it, and I’m glad they did. This book is a true gem, exploring topics like love, freedom, and purpose in a way that feels both timeless and deeply personal. It’s definitely one to keep handy—you’ll find yourself reaching for it again and again for guidance and inspiration. Although it was written over a century ago, its wisdom remains incredibly relevant. A must-read for anyone seeking insight and meaning. Almustafa is leaving. He is a prophet and in leaving there is poetry and a lesson in it too. Each human being needs help and guidance, but also the chance to grow by oneself. I found wisdom in 'The Prophet,' rather than the empty following of rules it elicits the awakening of oneself through reflection. Nevertheless I felt parts just as common sense, maybe I have not enough life experiences to notice the complete truth in all that is said, as words have another meaning when we made enough mistakes to awake to their significance. Perhaps 'The Prophet' is meant to be read in different stages of life.

The AmazonClassics Edition is the best to read works written in English. The modern typography and professional formatting makes a pleasure the reading; there is X-Ray although 'The Prophet' is so crystalline that I barely consulted it; and, what is important to me, there are no introductions nor footnotes by busybody intellectuals, the text is as pure as if it had been published this morning, it is pure for you to appreciate it without intermediaries in your terms. There is only a very succint biography at the end, a highly recommended edition. I bought this as a gift for my mom. She's never read Gibran, and I think she'll find deep meaning in his work as a spiritual person. The golds and blues on the cover are beautiful, and the binding is sturdy. ""And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow."" This book came in a sealed wrap. It is a very clean and Beautiful Book ""The Prophet"" is a series of poetic prose authored by Khalil Gibran in the early twentieth century. Mister Gibran was born in Lebanon and moved with his family to America as a child. This series of poetic prose has a somewhat abstruse and mystical aspect to it. It is clear to me that this book has many, many fans. I completely respect that. And there is no doubt that the writing is very poetic and at times beautiful. I had to read and reread much of this work numerous times to gain a partial comprehension of the work.

As an American, I make a concerted effort to read the works of authors born in other countries. In that context I really appreciated this reading experience. However I need to confess I ended up being glad that the work was short and was relieved when I had finished it.

I am very glad that I had a chance to read this work. But it was work. It is not a light read. I do not think that the average reader, looking for a light reading experience will particularly enjoy this work. I am sure there is wisdom to be found within. However it is not easily accessed. Speaking strictly for myself I get more from reading the Wisdom Books of the Old Testament of The Bible.

In summary, I am glad that I read this work. I was glad to study the life of the author. I purchased and audiobook narrated by Sandra Cullum and she did an excellent job. But the work is not a light read. My personal appreciation was mostly as a study experience and not every reader is going to enjoy this book. Thank You... Have listened to The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran a couple of times on Audible and really liked it so brought it on Kindle and read it. It is pretty interesting and it is quite clear why this is one of the most translated books in the world. All the topics covered such as love, marriage, children, giving, eating and drinking, laws, freedom, etc., everything feels written by a perspective of someone who’s a deep thinker. I guess I will probably read it a few more times again. While this book was written in 1923, it is timeless. If only everyone is a deep thinker like Kahlil Gibran, this world would have been peaceful and so much better and wonderful. A very short book, only 133 pages published in 1926. To be honest I have no idea why I downloaded this. I have a vague memory of listening to a radio programme on the author some time ago, which I found interesting, so it must have been that! Gibran is described in Wikipedia as, 'the third best selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.'

The book is written in bible-esque so if you are not a fan of that or indeed of religion it may not be a book for you. On the other hand and bearing in mind this was published in 1926 almost every passage can be related to every single one of us and our lives today.

There are no chapter numbers in this short volume but they are defined by the questions asked of 'The Prophet' by the assembled town folk as he prepares to leave them, returning to his 'home'.

Marriage
Children
Giving
Eating and Drinking
Work
Joy and Sorrow
Crime and Punishment
Freedom
Reason and Passion
Pain
Teaching
Friendship
Good and Evil
Prayer
Pleasure
Religion
Death

So many of the words written by Gibran over 80 years ago, must surely, if you are tempted to purchase this book, resonate with something in your life today and his simple but reasoning outlook will remind you to step back and reflect on how you look at life and maybe think that there is something that you can do to change, for the better, on how you interact with others and with yourself!

I'm not saying that I have had a religious or moral epiphany while reading this book, I personally still have no idea whether I am an atheist, agnostic or just a plane old fence sitter waiting for something different or better to come along, if that is indeed possible. I did write somewhere in regard to the Bible, and I suppose in the same tone the Koran would be included, that I look upon the former as a good novel and if only more people would read it (them) without the religious zealotry and bigotry surrounding it (them), the world would probably be a far better place for all humankind, but that aint gonna happen. But that should not take away from the fact that there are important life lessons in these works that are as relevant today as they were when they were written, as Mr Gibran's words, I believe, fall firmly within that description.

Enjoy.....

The War of the Worlds (AmazonClassics Edition),"A metallic cylinder falls to earth, landing in the sands of Horsell Common, Surrey, generating curiosity and awe. But what’s inside soon induces only terror. The story that unfolds is a breathless first-person account of an inconceivable reality: an extraterrestrial war has been waged on the planet.
In a twist on cautionary turn-of-the-century invasion literature, H. G. Wells posits the Martian attack as an insurmountable apocalyptic event. The first of its kind and a foundational work, The War of the Worlds inspired a radio broadcast, television shows, graphic novels, and countless films; roused the imagination and stirred anxieties; and changed the landscape of science fiction for generations.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The War of the Worlds, this edition of The War of the Worlds (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. ""The War of the Worlds"" must have seriously freaked people out in 1898. Imagine squeamish readers buckling at any unusual celestial event; the skies seemed impenetrable then. A falling star? No! It must be Martians! Augh! Run! The story retains a certain spine-tingling creepiness even today via historical imagination or present day extrapolation. It will evoke, for some, the I'd-better-look-over-my-shoulder-every-few-minutes syndrome. And though its quaint science may inspire derisive snorts today, then little was known about ""the Red Planet,"" especially whether it supported life. Add to that, the scientific theories of the day posited a Mars that, much like Earth, would cycle through geological and biological phases that culminated in life. So, to the general reader of the time, the notion of ""life on Mars"" remained not only a distinct possibility, but an almost certain inevitability. Plus, the people of late 19th century England had no early warning system for astronomical events. So when, early in the book, the first Martian ""cylinder"" plunges into the earth outside of London, only those nearby really know it happened. To top it off, news then traveled at the speed of print and human speech, the equivalent of frustratingly viscous molasses today. So, strange as it seems to our instantaneously informed modern world, news of the Martian invasion doesn't reach into London for some time. And when it does, many don't take it seriously as they see no direct threat. That changes fast as Martian death machines and black smoke smother everything in their path. Appreciating the book's true horror today involves conceiving our immediate solar system as an utter mystery. A sort of historical empathy. Sure, observations were made and scientists had rudimentary knowledge in the late 19th century, but no one really knew anything substantial about our neighboring planets. As such, ""The War of The Worlds,"" though obviously fiction, and serialized as such, probably didn't ring hollow for many readers of its time. With this perspective H.G. Wells' incredible storytelling powers begin to appear. They remain on full display throughout this page turner (or, for those using e-readers, this ""button pusher""). The story's implications and subtexts also seem to provide a model for science fiction up to our strange present where science, morality and self-referential anthropology mingle.

The story may or may not seem familiar to today's readers, depending upon which versions of the story one has come across. Orson Wells' famous, or infamous, 1938 radio adaptation, set in America, still resonates the power of mass media through rebroadcasts. And various film versions have appeared in the interim (some more memorable than others). But Wells' original story takes place in England through the perspective and words of a man of letters, or a ""philosophical writer."" The Martian invasion begins near his town of Woking. He subsequently witnesses the instant death of the ""heat-ray"" and the Martian tripod war machines. The indistinctness of his descriptions make these invaders and their weapons radiate with the horror of the unknown. Many passages genuinely read in the manner of a man delineating technology 100 years ahead of his own time. This heightens the helplessness of humanity, who flee all human-like in abject terror and chaos from the ensuing carnage, ignorant of the very nature of the powers they face (told mostly through the narrator's brother). The Martians proceed with brutality. Their ""rays"" and poison gas ""tubes"" reduce entire cities to piles of burnt corpses and edifices. If Wells' intentions involved reducing humanity to a helpless blabbering mass, he succeeded. Once the Martians have dominated, regardless of a few small human victories, humanity faces the prospect of living in a ""lowly animal state."" The character of the artilleryman manifests this idea, though he eventually shows his true colors. The character of the curate, who the narrator finds himself holed up with for days, paints a less than charitable picture of the religious response to the invasion. The man basically goes crazy after witnessing what the Martian's do with human prisoners. Whether God fails him, or whether he merely perceives that God has failed him, or that humans have ultimately failed God, remains a subject for speculation and discussion. In any case, things seem absolutely hopeless for humanity until the end. And, to keep from giving anything away, the ending implies something about humanity's relationship with the planet it inhabits. As the invasive, and very destructive, Martian ""red weed"" smothers the countryside, humans themselves don't ultimately prevail. But certain ""partners,"" both friend and enemy, come to the inadvertent rescue. In a sense, nature saves the day. No human weaponry of the time musters the firepower to bring down the invading army. ""War of the Worlds"" thus paints a picture not of human power, but of human impotency in the face of superior technology. In the end, humans don't play the role of triumphant heroes.

So what does this imply? That technology gets us only so far? That our sometimes arrogant perceptions of our power and might simply dissolve in the face of even more superior might? Maybe. At the very least it gives readers an idea of the potential limits of human power. Maybe horrors we could never prepare for, despite our advances, exist ""out there?"" Essentially, ""War of the Worlds"" presents a very humbling view of humanity, not a glorified one. It also presents a great fictional example of Nassim Taleb's ""Black Swan."" A Martian invasion, or any extraterrestrial invasion of superior power, would carry extreme consequences for humanity, but we may never see it coming. In modern terms, what if an alien force infiltrated us underneath our radars despite our perceived technological level? What we don't know might hurt us. Uncertainty usually wins the day. We may not know the extent of our own vulnerabilities.

""War of the Worlds"" stands as a justifiably hailed classic of literature and science fiction. Though in the end, despite the supermarket label, it's simply a great story. Potential interpretations at philosophical, social and technological levels provide enough mind food for weeks of munching. Plus, it provides a stunning read filled with horror, suspense and human drama. And though it's definitely not 1898 anymore, ""War of the Worlds"" may still hold enough power to freak people out. ""No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter . It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same.""

PROs:

* Classic sci-fi story

* In many senses created and popularized the sci-fi genre

* Vivid descriptions of Martians and the destruction they wrought

* Loved the scientific analysis of the Martians

* Real sense of dread instilled in a few moments

CONs:

* Extremely implausible story today

* Very boring when the book switches to the point of view of the writer's brother

* Not much character development

* Too little focus on the actual aliens for my taste

* Anticlimactic ending

* Unnecessary and oddly placed superstition

""Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all, beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant from time's beginning but nearer its end.""

H.G. Wells's 'The War of the Worlds' is, in my estimation, one of the few 'classics' that stands up to the title. It is certainly not the best sci-fi book ever written, in my opinion not even close to the best, but it's still a highly enjoyable read.

The book follows an anonymous, well educated writer recalling a recent, almost extinctive an alien invasion from Mars. (Remember, this was written in the 1800s, so intelligent beings on Mars was not nearly as implausible as it would be today.) The descriptions and images portrayed are real and detailed enough to make you feel like this event actually occurred, and at points, particularly in the beginning, the book is quite suspenseful. This feeling is never so strong as it is in the beginning, where it is said that the Martians have been unsympathetically observing us, and, unfortunately, the book never again reaches this point of wonder and suspense.

I found the descriptions and scientific analysis of the Martians to be, by far, the best parts of the book, particularly in two places - The beginning of the book, where the Martian environment is described and how this environment shaped their evolution is the first of these great moments. The second great moment is where the writer is in an advantageous spot where he is able to stealthily observe and analyze the Martian anatomy and physiology.

For me, the book suffers immensely when it turns from a sci-fi book into a thriller. In my opinion the descriptions of the fleeing citizens and wreckage of cities was quite boring (particularly when the point of emphasis switches from the original writer to his brother) and, regrettably, these descriptions probably took up over half of the book. It seems like the destruction of England itself was more of a focus than the actual alien invasion. The ending also left me very wanting and somewhat disappointed.

Overall, the excitement of the best moments are enough to overcome the dullness of the worst, leaving the book to be an enjoyable one.

""For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of men, yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well. I felt as a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house. I felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of dethronement, a persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an animal among the animals, under the Martian heel. With us it would be as with them , to lurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed away."" Movies and musicals have been inspired by this classic. I read mine in Kindle and was happy to be able to look up some words that where common at that time of writing, but not so much anymore. What an imagination, to use the germs as the thing that saves humanity. After all our egos and weapons were no match. His insights and his story telling where ahead of their time. Worth the time to sit down and read, forget the movies...but you can listen to the soundtrack...that rocks too. Wells had the hindsight for a concise writing style, ahead of many other authors of the time and a concise story. While the premise is simple, it is very well drawn out with fascinating descriptive writing of the central elements of the story. It also goes beyond the premise with a sense of progression and set of distinct yet flowing changes, a strong element of his writing, performed only better in Island of Dr Moreau. Given the familiar settings, the limited background description is understandable and reasonable. The pacing is very good with action well-spread. The one part that caps my praise is about 60% into the story: while the slowness may reflect the scene's context, it's too stark a contrast compared to all before and could have been eased in better if not reduced.

His studying background in politics, society and so fourth become apparent with the articulate and well-written 'accounts' of himself (the book written in first person with no given name) and of observations. A criticism meanwhile is the limited character depth or development. While the book is relatively short, there is little apparent depth to most prominent persons. Perhaps this is not suited to the book, however.

The book carries well into our times. The alien designs are unique: their like from the book has barely been explored since it was released, allowing it to keep a fresh perspective today. The ending circumstances are perhaps widely understood today however can still provide a good surprise when story turns like it have barely been seen since. The writing is also easy for one to read even with the rare archaic word as one can guess the intent by the sentence. Pas de critique. I'm not going to write a review on this classic - put simply i loved the book and would have loved it even more if the map had been located at the beginning of the book as I had real trouble sometimes keeping up with going ""north, south, southwest, etc"" and only discoverd the map upon finishing the book.
I'd like to say a few words though about the physical conditions off this edition (penguin classics, paperpack): They are as bad as they can get. After getting half through the book, the first pages started to break apart. Upon finishing the only thing that was left was a stack of loose pages. I would think that penguin for a ""CLASSIC EDITION"" would apply a more serious production standard. One that would AT LEAST allow for the book being read one time before falling apart.
I'm very disappointed by the quality of this edition and would recommend everyone to restrain from buying it and look for another one. Ya tenía este libro en español, pero quise leerlo en su idioma original. La portada es preciosa y viene con un listón integrado para separar las páginas. Me gustó mucho."
Darkness There: Selected Tales by Edgar Allan Poe [Kindle in Motion],"Edgar Allan Poe is known as the forefather of suspense and modern crime fiction. For the first time ever, Darkness There showcases some of his most famous tales with stunning digital illustrations. Each story explores a different twist of madness, murder, and melancholy, from the horror of being buried alive in “The Fall of the House of Usher” to the desperate case of two gruesome killings in “The Murders in the Rue Morgue.” The heartbeat of paranoia in “The Tell-Tale Heart,” the razor-sharp claustrophobia in “The Pit and the Pendulum,” and a mourner’s torment in “The Raven” reveal—and revel in—life’s creepiest and craziest. These tales are not for the faint of heart or the thin of skin. I am not reviewing the writings of Edgar Allen Poe but rather the ""Kindle in Motion"" format. I had never heard of this but was intrigued enough to purchase the book. This format contains subtle animations embedded within the illustrations throughout the book that can be turned on/off at any time. It adds a fun element to the stories without being distracting. I think that this format would work especially well in children's books, though adults would likely appreciate it too. The Kindle in Motion format has a lot of potential and I hope to see more titles in the future. These few Tales from E.A. Poe are among his best. Only “Murders in the Rue Morgue” is, in my unworthy opinion, a weaker and flawed work. Far more significant is “The Tell-Tale Heart,” an absolute masterpiece! This was my 2nd Kindle in Motion” ebook, and I remain mostly unimpressed by the format, primarily because there are so few illustrations, and the animation is limited. (Since my previous K.I.M. ebook, I have considered how much the file size would be increased by more animation. That would be a problem as things stand now.). What illustrations there are, however, are nearly all quite satisfying, the work of M.S. Corley. Love everything the illustration is amazing. Definitely worth the read. If you like Poe’s work it’s a must read book. While I have read a number of classics, this was my first reading of stories from Edgar Allan Poe. Having loved the old Vincent Price films, it was time to read the stories upon which some of the films were based. This was not quite what I had expected. While I normally love gothic horror, I found this collection to be somewhat disappointing. Only the Tell Tale Heart was interesting. The rest were overly long, excessive wordy, narratives that loss momentum for me. Having recently discovered the wonderful M.R. James, the difference is clear. Whereas James is able to ease you into a situation smoothly, his dialogs have a payoff and he keeps excessive descriptions out of his tales. He cuts to the heart of the matter and gets to the point. Poe's long diatribes made me lose interest. I read this book using immersion reading while listening to the audio book version. It was beautifully narrated by Malcolm Hillgartner. The Kindle in Motion book didn't bring that much to this work, few scenes were rendered. Glad this is over. It is always nice to read Edgar Allan Pies work.Fascinating reads of darkness . The artwork was beautiful and really made it fun I really enjoyed this book. I've been a fan of Poe for decades and was happy to see another book of his tales. I also appreciated the moving illustrations-wonderfully done!-which made reading some of my favorite tales quite a delight!

Enjoyable re-reading of Poe with wonderfully rendered moving illustrations. I'll DEFINITELY return to listen to the audio! Four stars. Good example of Poe's writing. He is not a gore writer. The horror seen is not discribed as much as the horror in the the thoughts of the person the story focuses on. Perhaps the kinetic artwork in this book overloads the finder's memory, or perhaps it's just the graceful Library page ""upgrade "" forced on Kindle users by Amazon, but whichever it is this very enjoyable Poe anthology is so s low to open that it's basically useless. I can't read it because it won't open. End of story before story begins Amazing!!! Never seen something like it before. Fun & Edgar Allan Poe seldom go together, but this book with its moving pictures is fun! Uma edição muito bem pensada e criativa. É uma pena os recursos de movimento não serem disponíveis na leitura com o Kindle. Assim, se você pensa em comprar essa edição especificamente por causa das animações e pretende ler no Kindle acho melhor reconsiderar... Mas de qualquer forma é uma edição feita com muito capricho, a leitura é ótima sem as animações também... Hauntingly beautiful works. The had me hanging on his every word. I had only heard of The Raven prior to this. However, I will be looking for more to red as I am now hooked on his writing. In effetti non ho riletto i racconti di Poe che già conoscevo, ma ho acquistato questo ebook della collana Kindle in Motion, solo per vedere come erano organizzate le animazioni. -Ricordarsi di attivare l'opzione ""Mostra media"" nel menu Aa del dispositivo in uso-.
In effetti sono fatte molto bene e vivacizzano il testo le cui pagine in background hanno anche inserti fissi con impronte digitali macchiate di sangue.
Complimenti a M.S. Corley, l'illustratore, perché le animazioni aggiungono esperienza emotiva al libro.

Unica pecca per niente trascurabile è il peso dell'ebook che corrisponde a 400 Mb, l'equivalente di quasi 200 ebook o 50 brevi filmati. In effetti un po' eccessivo, ma uno di questi vale la pena averlo su tablet o smartphone per mostrare le potenzialità del ePub."
Beowulf (AmazonClassics Edition),"The great drinking hall, Heorot, provides merriment for warriors and wenches alike. But it provokes only avenging rage from swamp creature Grendel. Now, in sixth-century Denmark's darkest hour, a light of hope comes in the warrior Beowulf of the Geats. With his quest to defeat Grendel and his vengeful demon mother, Beowulf embarks on a journey from the murky lagoon to the throne of the Geats.
Beowulf, the Old English epic poem published anonymously centuries ago, remains one of the most influential pieces of English literature, inspiring generations of writers from J. R. R. Tolkien to George R. R. Martin.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature?s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as Beowulf, this edition of Beowulf (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I remember my mother reading this story to us on a hot summer afternoon, especially when Beowulf tore off the monster's arm and tossed it into the rafters. When I started subbing, I tucked my well-worn paperback into my bag and would connive non-readers into reading it by saying, of course they wouldn't want to read something so bloody and violent. Invariably, they would grab it and be hooked.[muh-ha-ha]. This is one of those books I return to again and again because it has grown with me. Now, as an adult, I appreciate the end of the story when he fights the dragon alone. The tale gives me the courage to fight my own dragons.

A more recent translation has come out, but I prefer this one. The language is accessible. The rhythm of the original is preserved, but the translation isn't as literal. I read this book for the experience rather than to study Middle English.

I hated the movie, which was too cynical and too Hollywood. Beowulf is not a cynical story, but a noble one. There are cynical minor characters, but Beowulf is a hero through and through. If you want to know what a true hero is, if you want to know what makes a man, Beowulf can teach you. His lessons have lasted through time. That's the famous first word of Beowulf in this translation by Michael Alexander, first published in 1973 and now reissued as part of the handsome Penguin set Legends From the Ancient North. Beowulf is the earliest surviving substantial work in the languages which became English, and thus it has attracted attention from scores of scholares, including most notable J.R.R. Tolkien. An epic poem, Beowulf is set in the tumultuous world of the 5th and 6th centuries in the waters and lands around what is now Denmark, where warriors struggle to conquer fabulous monsters. It's a breathtakingly beautiful poem which will remind readers, not surprisingly, of some of the best of Tolkien's own poetry, particularly those of the Rohirrim.

This edition comes with a lengthy Introduction and Notes which allow non-specialists a clearer picture of the settings and characters. While this version of Beowulf may be less well known than the more recent one by Seamus Heaney, I found it to be an exciting and accessible read. Translated by Francis Barton Gummere (I mention it because Amazon displays all the reviews under different Beowulf editions) this book was harder than I thought. I am not a native English speaker but I have read essays about kennings and time ago I had seen that animated movie of Beowulf (whose cgi I didn't like that much) thus I was a bit prepared to read Beowulf... but not, I failed. The alliteration was quite musical, epic, it sounds stately when each line is read slowly in your mind, but in exchange was harder to understand the story. It doesn't help that other stories are mixed in between.

Nevertheless I liked it. As a whole I think it is a sum of many parts not blending well, a hydra. But the parts that make it are quite beautiful. The lines speak about swords that melt through blood, warriors that are brothers and make promises that involve kingdoms, the frigid sea and demigod strenght through decades of life. Grendel biting and mocking men. Each line in its alliteration lives in itself and dies in itself. Maybe in its original day this beauty was crystalline and made a whole story that I couldn't see. In another point there are Norse or Germanic Gods but not quite, and there is the Christian God, but not quite. Because the God in which Beowulf and his kinsmen believe is one a strong one that loves his warriors. So we have a book that, in reference to religion, is a bit a godless one, and that makes it interesting too, because it is pure human heart and will winning the battle. I'm of two minds about Beowulf.

One: The poetic flow of this edition is absolutely beautiful. It's silky-smooth, engrossing, and incredibly easy to read. The footnotes in each chapter serve well to explain certain anachronisms or confusing wordings - and to disambiguate characters when merely pronouns are used. I had no trouble reading this in terms of flow and word choices.

Two: Despite the beautiful poetic flow and helpful footnotes, I still highly doubt I'd have understood half of what was going on if I hadn't read the children's novel version from Wishbone first. My brain and long sentences with creative structures just don't get along - at least insofar as comprehension is concerned.

How do I translate that into a rating? Well, I know I enjoyed the story itself when I read a prose-based retelling. And I know I had fun reading the poem version, even if I struggled a bit with comprehension. I will admit, however, I think I accidentally skimmed - or turned my brain off when reading, maybe - several times, when there wasn't much going on to hold full attention. This happens to me with poetry in general, so I don't feel right faulting Beowulf for it.

I do think it was a touch too long and the plot a little convoluted, but... it's not bad. It's not the best thing ever, but it's not bad. I don't regret spending the night reading this. Thus, I think I'm gonna go with three stars. I like it, but don't love it. And this particular edition is well-formatted with useful information. After I watched the movie, I just had to read the book. Mind it, this is not an easy read. But it is totally worth spending time on. an amazing concept and a beautiful story crafted around it. Those nordic stories anyway are quite enthralling. great book for all serious students of the poem and all those trying to get behind the many English translations, to what the words are. Every noun adjective and verb on every line is directly given its one nearest meaning on the opposite page by the most pedestrian/scholarly of translators - just what is needed to appreciate the lovely poetic interpretations of K.Crossley-Holland and S.Heaney etc. Some good and thorough introductory material by the scholarly M.Alexander Perfect. Thanks ! Boa tradução. Excelente livro. Escrito en inglés antiguo. Difícil de leer pero muy interesante."
As a Man Thinketh (AmazonClassics Edition),"“As you dream,” philosopher and poet James Allen wrote, “so shall you become.” First published in 1903, this seminal self-help classic laid the foundation for today’s mindfulness practices and teachings. One of the first to explore the power of positive thought, Allen illuminated its effect on character, circumstance, health and body, purpose, achievement, ideals, and serenity. The root of Allen’s beliefs? That success, personal fulfillment, and inner peace really are all in your mind.
Revolutionary and enduring, the practical, profound, and simple meditations in this groundbreaking work still resonate after more than a century, and they have established its author as the father of the New Thought movement.
Revised edition: Previously published as As a Man Thinketh, this edition of As a Man Thinketh (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This was an impeccable read; short yet full of life-changing principles. I think I will make it a yearly tradition to read this book Read a mere page daily. Read the book over and over again until you accomplish that which you seek to have in life and become a living example of calm, success and positivity! I feel compelled to defend this book against the ignorant remarks by previous reviews like that by A. Brown below. This is NOT a new-age book. Had he read the book he would know that the book was written by a shy, humble man named James Allan in the year 1904. Last I checked 1904 wasn't the peak of new-age thought.

The author never asserts that if you think ""rich rich rich"" you will become rich any more than thinking ""unicorn, unicorn unicorn"" will turn you into a mythical creature. The premise of this short yet remarkable book is that you can shape your destiny simply choosing to think positive thoughts. If you preoccupy yourself with your fears and self doubt, you will most certainly be a slave to these negative thoughts. These self defeating thoughts only serve to prevent you from success. If you think positive thoughts, you're putting yourself on the path of success. Focus on your strengths, don't let thoughts of self-doubt harbor in you. The concepts are not new and hardly new-age. There are no new ideas in this book, Mr Allan was just the first to present them is all.

James Allan emphsizes the importance of hard work and effort throughout the book. He states in the book ""He who would accomplish little must sacrifice little. He who would achieve much must sacrifice much. He who would attain highly must sacrifice greatly."" Effort and sacrifice are common themes throughout the book. James Allan makes the point that all your hard work will be in vain if your mind is filled with thoughts of failure.

Read some books by Rick Patino, Jack Welch, Vince Lombardi, Sammy Davis Jr (on a side note, Sammy Davis jr's book is even called ""Yes I Can"" which is what he would tell himself whenever negative thoughts crept in his head) or anyone who overcame the odds to be a huge success and you will see that they live their lives exactly as James Allan advises, they think only positive thoughts, they visualize their success rather than being fixated with their weaknesses. Nothing new age about it folks. In the style in which this book is written, it is a nice slow read. It requires the reader to take their time and absorb each sentence and reflect while reading, I enjoy that style. What I also enjoyed was the author's words are still applicable today if we want to find our authentic self. All the above reviews are accurate. I have read many books in the self help, better thyself, think positive (etc) category over the years but there is something about this that is just awesome. I can't explain it any other way. If you are considering the purchase go ahead and get it. Like attracts like and either you heard about this book or someone recommended it to you. Without being too mystical I will simply say there is a reason for it and you do need to get and read this book.

This edition contains not only As a Man Thinketh which has been well reviewed, but also From Poverty to Power. I have been reading From Poverty to Power a few pages at a time and I think it is just as powerful if not more powerful than As a Man Thinketh. The table of contents gives you a good idea of what is in store:

Part 1 The Path of Prosperity
- The Lesson of Evil
- The World a Reflex of Mental States
- The Way Out of Undesirable Conditions
- The Silent Power of Thought: Controlling and Directing One's Forces
- The Secret of Health, Success, and Power
- The Secret of Abounding Happiness
- The Realization of Prosperity

Part 2 The Way of Peace
- The Power of Meditation
- The Two Masters, Self and Truth
- The Acquisition of Spiritual Power
- The Realization of Selfless Love
- Entering into the Infinite
- Saints, Sages, and Saviors: The Law of Service
- The Realization of Perfect Peace

All told between the two books it is a total of 209 pages that are easy to read, understand, and with some effort apply in your daily life.

Best wishes for a prosperous future and enjoy the book! En éste libro se describe claramente lo que cualquiera que esté buscando su desarrollo personal necesita: controlar sus pensamientos es controlar su destino. 🇳🇦 Ich habe dieses Buch schon mehrmals jungen Männern mit auf den Lebensweg gegeben. (Z.B. Konfirmation). Es ist weise und kann als Hilfe dienen, das Leben zu meistern.

I recommande it for those who really want to move along in life and build their futur."
The Age of Innocence (AmazonClassics Edition),"It’s the perfect match—gentleman lawyer Newland Archer will marry young socialite May Welland. The marriage should be a source of pride for Newland, accustomed as he is to meeting the expectations of New York’s high society. But when he falls for May’s exotic and enchanting cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska, he faces an impossible choice: should he be the dutiful husband and stay with his bride, or give in to his passions and follow the countess around the world?
A classic that encapsulates the etiquette of the times, The Age of Innocence is as much about loyalty, duty, and decorum as it is about desire.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Age of Innocence, this edition of The Age of Innocence (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. For a long time, I was puzzled that The Age of Innocence had won the Pulitzer for fiction in 1921, because Edith Wharton sucked.

When I was an undergrad I had to read a different, more obscure Edith Wharton novel (I won't say which one), and it was horrid. I looooathed it. The plot was feeble and uninteresting, the female protagonist vapid, the male supporting characters even more repulsive. In fiction, I read primarily for human drama and interaction, and if I don't feel that the characters are well-developed and have verisimilitude, I don't feel like reading on. I don't have to like a character or want them as a neighbor, but they have to be interesting. Well, Ms. Wharton's characters in that other, weaker novel were neither likable nor interesting. I was required to finish that novel, but then I was done with Edith Wharton forever.

Since then, otherwise literate people have suggested that I read The Age of Innocence. I always declined. Recently, though, a writer friend hounded me enough that I accepted the loaner copy she pushed into my hands and promised I would at least try it. Thirty pages or so, I promised.

Less than ten pages in, I was hooked. Remember what I said up there about the character-driven novel? Here it is, in spades. If you aren't familiar with the story (no spoilers, I promise), it takes place in New York in the 1870s and centers on a young upper-class attorney, Newland Archer. Though narrated in third person, the reader is privy to Newland's thoughts, ideas, emotions, conflicts. He is engaged to a reputable young woman, but becomes infatuated with her cousin, who is not so reputable. This unfortunate triad (can you feel the tension?) exists in the social minefield of high society, scandal is avoided at all costs, appearances are everything and therefore hypocrisy is the norm. Newland detests his social matrix, but he also benefits from it and it's where he's generally comfortable, so he plays the game. May (his fiancée) and Ellen (her exotic cousin) each have a complicated relationship with society, as well. Their relationships, their choices (or failures to choose) and the consequences drive the action of the novel, and that was all well and good, but I kept reading because Newland and May and Ellen were so very, very real. They were complex, and the choices presented to them were not black and white (hey, just like real life). Newland's interior conflicts constitute the bulk of this luscious reading; however, without getting right into their heads, Wharton portrays both May and Ellen so sympathetically that we, the readers, pick up the cues that Newland misses in order to understand what they're experiencing, too.

This novel is often cited as a masterful portrait of the high society of that time and place, most notably of its shortcomings. Yes, it is that, and yes, it's so well written that you feel yourself needing to step out for air because you're suffocating in that byzantine system of propriety. More than that, though, this novel is about human beings and how they behave when they have to make difficult choices. All the great novels are. This was my first experience reading a book by Edith Wharton. Her writing style is truly masterful. Whether a week passes or decades pass between chapters, Wharton paints the scenes so vividly. For me, the story read as a commentary on the things we communicate without words. As much is communicated in the blank spaces as in the words we say.

The Age of Innocence felt like an American cousin to a Jane Austen novel. It’s very easy to read. At first, there were a lot of names to keep straight, but the same crowd of characters remains throughout. There were themes that challenged some of my personal morals and beliefs — I’m not sure I could say Newland Archer is a hero. Overall, it was an enjoyable story with a few gentle twists and turns along the way. This is without a doubt dear Mrs. Wharton's masterpiece, a captivating tale about a man whose sense of duty and fear of challenging the status quo keeps him in a state of perpetual staleness and regret. While very little transpires through the course of the novel, it is for a good reason. Archer, the protagonist, is a stuffy New York lawyer, who is entranced by his mysterious wife's cousin Olenska, a married countess who has spent a great deal of her life in Europe. The story is about their relationship or what it could have been, had he been more willing to challenge the status quo and follow his real desires. He lives in a world surrounded by the moralistic and the prudish, a world which by the end of the novel vanishes into a distant memory, and all he is left with is his regret. In the sense, the story could be viewed as a tragedy, but not the same kind of tragedy as Ethan Frome, who had so much less in life to look forward to! Archer's world is essentially limitless and is only held back by his own failure to think outside the Victorian box.

While little goes on in Archer's life, we are left to wonder about his true love Madame Olenska. Wharton leaves it to the reader to decide what they think about Olenska. She is not unattainable as Daisy Buchanan is in The Great Gatsby; she shares feelings for him and is eager to separate from her husband. Still, her relationship with Archer never comes to fruition, even after Archer's wife passes away. Her world is too rich and Archer, in his narrowness, can never wrap his head around it.

There are also a host of interesting characters that surround them, from the first Mrs. Manson Mingott to the conniving Beaufort, and , however limited their roles, they lend a great deal of insight to the ""age of innocence,"" which serves as the setting. It is an age of hypocrisy and narrow-mindedness, which is quickly superseded by the generation of Archer's son Dallas, who dispels all the mystique behind Archer's lack of action. Dallas represents the dream which Archer could not attain. By the end of the novel, it is too late for him and his only hope is for his son to live this dream for him.

The novel is full of rich detail and is well worth reading, even though the plot is at times rather slow. Without doubt, it belongs in any list of the greatest novels of the 20th century! classic novel by E.Wharton I'm glad I picked this up as I loved the movie with Daniel Day Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Winona Ryder, and I'm happy I finally get to enjoy Wharton's original, captivating prose.

The reason I am only giving this 3 stars is because this physical copy feels like one of those poorly produced cheap copies by ""independent publishers"" that can get away with selling this because the text is in the public domain. It's perfectly readable if that's all you need, but the margins on the back cover are obviously uneven, and the pages just feel a bit too ""copy-pasted"" and not very professional. It says ""made in the USA"" on a back page but the publisher listed in the front says it's in Bulgaria. If you want a quality printed product, I'd recommend spending your money on a different edition. Classic , worth reading and enjoying. Storyline, language, captures the imagination as well as essence of those times. Would recommend Todo muy correcto y muy rápido. Tal y como pone en el anuncio. Volvería a comprar este artículo otra vez J'ai découvert la plume d'Edith Wharton avec ce roman.
Une jolie lecture, la romance qui se tisse entre les deux personnages est intéressante et on a toujours envie d'en lire plus. Cependant, le rythme se tarit parfois et le récit souffre de quelques longueurs.
Malgré tout, j'ai rapidement été emportée par l'histoire et par cette société New Yorkaise tentant tant bien que mal de se cacher derrière des convenances viellissantes. Consigliato a chiunque voglia immergersi nelle atmosfere tipiche dell'America della Ricostruzione. Un grande classico, una grande storia d'amore che non smette mai di esercitare il suo fascino. I quite enjoyed reading this book. I do enjoy history and reading novels of this period gives you a great insight of the way of life. I have purchased a number of these books now. The maroon cover is lovely, the red satin ribbon page marker is just nice. Again I will have to say that the company printing these books in India need to take more care in their products. The print changes, its crooked, it goes from light to dark. A suggestion would be when you receive these books is to look through them before the return cut off date. Apart from that, I would recommend the read."
Through the Looking-Glass (AmazonClassics Edition),"When Alice steps through a mirror, she enters a reflection of her world where backwards is forwards, the future is remembered, and only the opposite of logic makes sense. Increasingly befuddled, she’s challenged by the belligerent Humpty Dumpty, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the nonsense rhymes of the Jabberwocky, and the discovery that she’s a pawn in a living game of chess. To become queen and find her way home, Alice must play.
A masterpiece of the absurd, Lewis Carroll’s sequel to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland continues to inspire artists, filmmakers, musicians, and writers after all these years.
Revised edition: Previously published as Through the Looking-Glass, this edition of Through the Looking-Glass (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Through the Looking Glass is the sequel to Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, and it's just as delightful an adventure as the first. Alice steps through her mirror into Looking Glass World where writing is backwards and cake must be passed round before it's cut. We meet with more humorous characters like Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, and the Red and White Queens.

Through the Looking Glass is more logical than Wonderland, Alice is moving across the land square by square like a chess board, and meeting characters in each square. It still seems like a dream but it's less... trippy. I also like Alice herself more in the second book, she's less argumentative and confused. Some of her fancies are so sweet, like when Alice describes the snow loving the trees and fields and kissing them gently.

I think Wonderland has the better characters, with the Chesire Cat, Mad Hatter, and the white rabbit, while Looking Glass has the better poetry with Walrus and the Carpenter and The Jabberwocky. It's billed as a children's story but the puns tickled my funny bone and I enjoyed it much more hearing it as an adult.

I listened to the audible version by Jack Nolan, and he did a great job as narrator, he gave each character a separate speaking voice but they weren't overdone. They fit in really well and didn't distract from the story. I really liked the cool editing feature during the first attempt at The Jabberwocky! People often think this is one and the same as Alice and Wonderland but it was another of Lewis Carrol's books written for his friends children and explores other elements of the characters...It is nice to read bith and see him develop intto an ever greater story teller as he grows and that he is using his love for poems and lyrics.
If you want a suprising take on Lewis Carrol...read his bio...not the man you think or even his real name...!50 years of reading and still strong! Remember this photo is not this book! ""Alice"" was a favorite of my childhood. But would it stand up to the current zeitgeist, or like so many other books of that time seemed faded and dull? Happy to say, good writing never dies. The delightful toungue-in-cheek humor is as fresh now as it was then. And this particular edition, with the original Tenniel illustrations is like all good art...timeless. For those of us of a certain age with grandchildren far more interested in what they see on their cell phones, all I can say is, they don't know what they're missing.
So read on, Alice fans, and relive the joy you had so many years ago when you read ""Alice"". In this story, Alice is now seven years old. The context is that she dreamed herself back to wonderland. Here, she encountered living chess pieces rather than the living cards in the previous novel.

Like before, there were magical creatures in the story —talking animals and objects, kings and queens, a knight, an egg, etc. Although different from each other, their commonality is that most don't make any sense at all.

So, what I gather from the adventures of Alice this time around is that there is a lot of nonsense in the world and also, I have pick your battles. While on the flipside, maybe I know a lot of things already in life but I should never stop learning and listen to other people's perspectives. Perhaps, I just have to know better which to ignore and what value to take.

I said the above because the story is crazy and at times don't make sense at all. Maybe, that's the lesson to be learned. This is a sequel to ""Alice In Wonderland"" by Lewis Carroll. I had first read these works as a youth and am now scouting appropriate reading martial for my grandchildren. I am amazed at how much I enjoyed rereading this work. I found it really quite clever and humorous. I also purchased an audiobook version of this and found it to be quite good and really enjoyable. I believe I spent $2.99 for the audiobook.

Lewis Carroll is the pen name of Charles L. Dodgson. This gentleman was extremely bright. He had some health issues and a stammer. There are unproven suggestions that he had an abnormal interest in juvenile females. I had no sense of that in my reading. However, be this as it may, I feel this work is very clever and well worthy of sharing a reading experience with my grandson. Thank You... I love Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. I read it as a teen and have loved it ever since, and was happy to get to listen to the story. Each time reading (or listening) to this book is like a new experience, and I take something different from the story every time. The story is deeply but gently satiric, enlivened with an imaginative plot and brilliant use of nonsense. As Alice explores a bizarre underground world, she encounters a cast of strange characters and fanciful beasts: the White Rabbit, March Hare, and Mad Hatter; the sleepy Dormouse and grinning Cheshire Cat; the Mock Turtle, the dreadful Queen of Hearts, and a host of other extraordinary personalities. The tale plays with logic, making the story popular with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Yes, you’ll get a good feel for what could have been a complete break from reality...or certainly a commentary on the climate in 19th Century England. This classic story of Alice, the cats, Humpty Dumpty, the Red Queen and other famous characters. A fun read and one with depth- I think. Live imagination that takes you along a journey of adventure! An enjoyable read, I can't wait to read to any little ones I need to babysit in the near future. Clássico é clássico!!! Peguei esse material para analisar e usar em minhas aulas de inglês, acabei me interessando muito pela história. Lo compré para kindle, está muy bien Bought the Kindle version, very clean and nice font, ease to read format. I really enjoyed reading this book along with Alice's adventure in Wonderland, and totally become a fan of Lewis Carroll. The book doesn't contain any illustration. Que más se puede pedir que un libro en tu E-book o tablet de forma gratuita y en inglés. Genial!"
The Moonstone (AmazonClassics Edition),"Bequeathed a rare diamond by her late uncle, heiress Rachel Verinder has no idea it was stolen from an Indian temple or that it has a cursed history. When the diamond disappears on her eighteenth birthday, multiple suspects—including Rachel’s suitor, Franklin Blake—are implicated in its theft. Determined to prove his innocence, Franklin begins his own investigation. Did one of his fellow Englishmen steal the jewel? Or was it whisked back to India? The case, which unfolds through multiple narratives, takes startling twists and turns in pursuit of the truth.
Widely considered the first great detective novel written in English, The Moonstone is one of Wilkie Collins’s most famous works.
AmazonClassics brings you timeless works from the masters of storytelling. Ideal for anyone who wants to read a great work for the first time or rediscover an old favorite, these new editions open the door to literature’s most unforgettable characters and beloved worlds.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Moonstone, this edition of The Moonstone (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Before there was Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot, there was a tale of drugs, suicide, a stolen Indian diamond and a reported curse.

Specifically, there was ""The Moonstone,"" a long and twisting Victorian tale that is considered the first mystery novel in the English language. Wilkie Collins's writing can be a bit dense at times (well, it IS a Victorian story) but it also has a cast of quirky characters in a very colorful story, and an unusually forward-thinking approach to class. How many other novels of this type have the BUTLER as the narrator?

After ten years in continental Europe, Franklin Blake returns to England to bring his cousin Rachel Verinder her eighteenth birthday present: a massive diamond called the Moonstone. It was left to her by her vile uncle, possibly as a malicious act -- three Hindu priests are lurking nearby, hoping to reclaim the sacred gem stolen from them long ago. Everyone except Rachel really wants the diamond split up, so it will no longer be a danger.

At the same time, Rachel is being wooed by two men -- the somewhat irresponsible young Franklin, and the prosperous but less attractive Godfrey Ablewhite. And a timid, deformed young maid named Rosanna has fallen desperately in love with Franklin (though he's completely oblivious to this).

Then after a dinner party, the Moonstone vanishes, leaving a smudge on a newly-painted door as the only clue. It seems that only someone in the house could have stolen it. But it doesn't turn up in any police sweeps, the priests have alibis, and Rachel flatly refuses to let Sergeant Cuff investigate further. She also refuses to speak to Franklin again. And after several months, Franklin learns of some new clues that could reveal who stole the Moonstone. With the now-retired Cuff and a disgraced doctor's assistant helping him, he sets out to unravel the mystery once and for all.

""The Moonstone"" contains a lot of the tropes that later detective novels would use -- reenactment of the crime, red herrings, the culprit being the least likely suspect, and an English country house where you wouldn't expect a theft to take place. It even has TWO detectives -- a quirky police sergeant with plenty of brains, and a gentleman who is bright but kind of inexperienced.

Collins' prose can be a bit bloated at times, but he keeps it moving fast with lots of romantic drama and a hefty dose of humor (the insufferably pious Miss Clack: ""Oh, be morally tidy. Let your faith be as your stockings, and your stockings as your faith""). He also switches between different perspectives throughout the book -- part is from the butler Mr. Betteridge, part is from Miss Clack, part is from Franklin Blake himself, and there are little snatches of text from various other people.

And it's quirky. Very quirky. At times it feels like the Victorian equivalent of a Wes Anderson movie, between Betteridge's fanboy preoccupation with Robinson Crusoe (which he uses for EVERYTHING) or Cuff's love of roses (which you wouldn't immediately associate with an elite police detective).

But there is a serious side to Collins' writing as well. Yes, ""The Moonstone"" has some uncomfortably sexist or racist moments, but he was never afraid to take a jab at the foibles of his own society -- hypocritical piety, stainable reputations or then-legal drug addiction. He also takes an unusually compassionate approach to the servant class in the character of Rosanna Spearman -- though she is plain, deformed and has a checkered history, Collins never mocks her or her hopeless love of Franklin.

He also provides us with a wide range of characters -- from wild young men to stately ladies, from a genial butler to the mysterious priests who are the likeliest suspects... but didn't actually do it. Rachel's melodrama can be a bit irritating at times (why didn't she confront Franklin?), but Franklin grows into a more responsible, thoughtful young man over the story, and he's balanced out nicely by the age and experience of the quirky Cuff and Betteridge.

""The Moonstone"" is still a delightful read -- a powerful and sometimes tragic mystery, tempered with quirky humor and a likable cast of characters. While a bit overlong at times, it's still an outstanding little whodunnit. (Review for AmazonClassics and Dream Classics editions)

Marilyn Manson has written, and I agree, that ""occasionally, something will happen that will change your opinion of someone irrevocably, that will shatter the ideal you've built up..."" This story, this very important novel of the policial genre, suffers from the length with which the characters narrate their own participation in the main event. It can be expressed in the formula e=mc2, where E is the tiredness of my energy, equal to the product of the mass of words they write, multiplied by the velocity of light squared. Gabriel Betteredge is a lovable butler, loyal and tolerant, but insists so much about Robinson Crusoe and the defects of his deceased wife that almost turns into a bully; Miss Clack is a cute woman that care about religion, but the extension of her chapters make her look as an egotistical fanatic. They are the most notorious examples, but I'd say it applies for almost all protagonists. In the same way the extraordinary Moonstone has a small flaw in its core I think this unnecessary length a small flaw in the core of a very interesting story.

The policial genre maybe is the worst genre to review because it doesn't admit spoilers, as the revelation of the mystery is the core of it. So I will limit to mention what is safe to mention. The book is about the loss of a big diamond hunted by three Indians that have sworn to their gods to watch it until return it to India. The circumstances of the mystery are explained with great detail and just some parts are insinuated but not totally hidden. Different protagonists tell their part of their story according to the chronology of the events. Among the parts I loved are:

* The burning, in middle of the story, of a paper in which is written the name of the responsible of the loss of the diamond. We are so close to know it but it turn to ashes. It is, somehow, diabolical.
* The intrusion of horror in the shape of a misshaped and wretched girl. There is a part where one of the protagonists almost feels her emerging from the sea water above the quicksands. A gloomy vision that is scarier than the idea of a cursed diamond.
* The contrast of the polite British etiquette and ceremonies of the epoch with the outburst of the characters when the tension of the loss make them explode in outbursts of drama.
* The twists, they are quite amazing, as in our modern TV series (the good ones, it is)

There are some aspects that maybe are a tad far fetched as the way the characters seem to get in love quite easily; or the high horses from which some characters lecture others. Also there seems to be an ideological subtext, the one I cannot put my finger on; but I'd say Wilkie Collins seems to favor eccentric characters (i.e. Betteredge, Mr. Blake, Dr. Jennings) above religious or traditional ones (Miss Clack, the first police investigator, and the three Brahmin a bit) I know it is a strategy to divert the attention from real suspects to innocent ones, but I feel there is also some social denounce. Anyway, far from that century and country the answer is meaningless and it doesn't deprive from the adventure to read this book. Maybe I could read it again, and that intention, in the policial genre that only survives one reading, is testament of how good it is.

About the edition I read the AmazonClassics edition, and I compared it to the Dream Classics edition I had got time before. The AmazonClassics edition is by far the more enjoyable one: you have a clean and modern typography, excellent formatting, and the way to highlight the subtleties (cursives in AmazonClassics and capitals in Dream Classics) is less distracting. The only negative, in the AmazonClassics edition, is the reference to kindle versions of books mentioned. I love that function but the butler, Gabriel Betteredge, mentions Robinson Crusoe a lot, so it appears advertised in the AmazonClassics a lot too, I am not sure if it is possible to deactivate that option but nevertheless, I felt like Daniel Defoe had paid Amazon to get publicity for his book xD Curiously the mention of the important Confessions of an English Opium-Eater doesn't trigger a link to any kindle version, what is a shame because it is a wonderful book if you love, as I do, the British 19th century literature. Those very minor nuisances aside the main advantage of the AmazonClassics edition is the presence of X-Ray, super valuable for policial genre in which you need to know who is who, so probably this is the best edition you can get. Kitap çok özenli paketlenmişti. Basımı da çok güzel. Tavsiye ederim. Wonderful read.A great mystery novel with great characters such as Gabriel Betteridge with his ""Robinson Crusoe and Ezra Jennings as well as the main characters. The book is just a photocopy. Lines are missing, can't highlight passages because it's just a picture basically. Really low quality and not worth even 2,69. Very disappointing.
The story is great though, but I recommend finding a different version. Regarded as the first ever detective novel this is a real page turner once you get into the Victorian era prose. Highly recommended from a historical influence perspective but also a well plotted and written book. L'editore non si smentisce, libro ottimo per una didattica pre-avanzata con sufficienti riflessioni e spunti per imparare, presenta esercizi riassuntivi davvero utili per imparare al meglio ed inoltre è molto scorrevole. A completare il tutto c'è un cd che presenta l'audio dell'intero libro ed anche alcuni esercizi dedicati all'ascolto."
Southern Horrors & The Red Record (AmazonClassics Edition),"In the United States at the turn of the nineteenth century, crusading African American journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett bravely reported on the scourge of white supremacist violence that had personally impacted her own life and work. Her reporting exposed and riled the South, enlightened uninformed Northerners, and captured international attention.
Southern Horrors and The Red Record offer extensive accounts of the lynching, cruelty, and hate that African Americans faced in the early years of the Jim Crow South. Unafraid of the opposition, she also delved into the social, sexual, and political oppression of women as no one had before. This progressive and courageous work made her the most famous Black woman in the country. With an incredible prescience and a frank, clear-eyed tone, Wells-Barnett’s outrage—often indicated by the simple enumeration of names, dates, and statistics—resonates just as powerfully now as it did then. Her call for justice is a call that we still need to hear.
Revised edition: Previously published as Southern Horrors & The Red Record, this edition of Southern Horrors & The Red Record (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. This is a horrifying account of what happened to so many Black men and women in the late 1890's. Mrs. Wells-Barnett offers names, dates and locations where many of the lynchings occurred. The reasons for most of the lynchings were supposed to be for Black men raping White women. In many of the cases, it was confessed that the acts were consensual, however those facts could not be used as proof to the White man.

As a consequence, many hundreds of Black men were lynched by angry white mobs and after being lynched, their dead bodies were filled with bullets while still hanging. According to Mrs. Wells-Barnett's account, many were taken down by the mobs and their bodies were burned.
Strange Fruit indeed!!!

WLM
SC This is not a easy book.

But the racial history of the USA is never to be categorized as easy.

This book surprised me. I knew of the history of racist lynchings in American history but I was unaware of how much of it was due to sexual jealousy of white men concerning the relationships of black men with white women.

It’s almost laughable now if it wasn’t such a tragic and dark and bloody spot in history. Yet this new grain of knowledge fascinates me. The fact that animal lust, human envy, and white hypocrisy led to such a vitriolic epoch in time. How absurd.

One must make sense of the past to understand the present and predict the future. Yes this is a classic and I'd love to give it 5 stars but its a book about the horrors of lynching which describe the act in grotesque details. Its well written but eventually becomes nauseating and difficult to finish. Its an important book and important topic to be educated on though. While this is not happy, by any means, this is a necessary text. Recognizing our history is important, especially when it’s not positive. I am so grateful for Ida B. Wells and all of the foremothers and forefathers before me. It is an honor to be able to read her timeless work as a guiding light shone from the past towards the future. Thank you is not enough but happily given to her. This is a seriously deep dive into our American history and an eye-opening account of mainly, but not exclusively, southern white America's response to the loss of black humanity as property to be worked, raped, bred and sold, beaten (but seldom killed) juxtaposed against an emancipated race struggling to live under Lynch Law. Added as required reading and discussion for all high-school students. May help students look more closely at how our laws work or don't work in our country; what part do they play in our truth.

high-schoolers This is the American history that the conservative majority desires to keep hidden. It should be required reading for all high school and college students. Akin to the lynchings in the 1890’s, the mob violence of January 6 reflects the disdain for the rule of law and an embrace of mob rule. Read this book and wake up people!"
Candide (AmazonClassics Edition),"Candide, the illegitimate nephew of a German baron and student of eternal optimist Pangloss, is living a simple and sheltered life in “the best of all possible worlds.”
But when Candide falls in love with the wrong woman, his uncle’s young daughter, he is exiled from the baron’s castle and suffers great tragedy and catastrophe, which leaves him disillusioned and questioning the goodness of the universe.
Penned in just three days—and published in secret because of its blasphemous and seditious nature—Voltaire’s legendary satire deftly skewers religious, romantic, and political naïveté with an acerbic and ribald wit that delights to this day.
Revised edition: Previously published as Candide, this edition of Candide (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. After purchasing and reading Candide, the reader is left with the imprint of explicit and oppressive themes that occurred throughout the entire story. The author uses elements of oppression, war, philosophy and religion to develop similar themes and create a rather enthralling story. Voltaire used clashing archetypes to create complex relationships between characters. This review will elaborate on how the time period, themes and archetypes in the story contributed to the overall work as a whole.
Candide was written in 1758 by Voltaire; a French philosopher and writer. He is known for his criticism towards Christianity, more specifically the Catholic Church, and throughout Candide the development of satirical themes are evident due to this. The satire used in the story allows the reader to better understand Voltaire’s opinions towards Catholic Church as well as other religions and philosophies.
The novel is centered around the notion of philosophical optimism, an ideology associated with German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. It is the idea that everything happens for the best and that we live in the best of all possible worlds. Pangloss served as a mentor who taught Candide and Cunégonde this philosophy. Candide is the hero of the story who, throughout his travels, experiences many events and meets many people with varying ideologies and religions as him. There were questions that arose within Candide of who is right, who is wrong and if everything happens for the best, how can such terrible things happen to good people? These questions created an intriguing crash between the archetypes of Pangloss and Candide, because although Candide sees him has a wise mentor, he couldn’t help but question and and rebel against some of his teachings that he had previously lived by.
The story progressed through the use of location. Candide was born in Westphalia, Germany where he lived with the Baron, his wife, their daughter Cunegonde and their tutor Pangloss. Cunegonde and Candide were quite fond of each other, and one day where they kissed Candide was kicked out of the estate because she was a higher class than him. Once Candide leaves, he is taken by Bulgarian soldiers to travel with them, Eventually, after being mistreated and leaving them, he arrives in Holland. The plot thereafter is catastrophic in the seeing that Candide proceeded to travel to tens of places. In each place Candide experienced something new, whether it be religious oppression or notices self-righteous people of war. Although everything he experienced was clearly negative in every sense, he continues to naively live by the same idea of Optimism that Pangloss had once taught him. Candide is reunited with Pangloss, but only briefly, because both of them are whipped at the Catholic church for their varying religious views. The purpose of this was clearly satirical and contributes of Voltaire’s personal beliefs as well as how the church could be seen as contradicting to its apparently peaceful ways. Nonetheless, Candide did see this as another reason to illuminate his teachings from Pangloss and how this all happened for the best.
All the events that would follow were also tragic. From having to escape Holland, reuniting with Cunegonde but finding out the hardships she faced that were sexually oppressive, being shipwrecked in Lisbon, meeting Cacambo and going to El Dorado only to be utterly unsatisfied with their religion and way of life, a disastrous trip to Paris that lead to Candide losing his money, etc. All of these events came directly after another which contributes to the theme of endless hardships. For most of these situations, Candide and who ever he was with were struggling yet the clear answer for Candide was optimism and that everything that had happened up to that point had been the best possible outcome of all worlds. It is this ignorance that contributes to the overwhelming satire purposely placed in this story by Voltaire.
After purchasing and analysing Candide by Voltaire, it can be said that it was rather intriguing. The use of clashing archetypes, overwhelming satire, and interesting themes ensure that the reader will definitely be entertained. All of these element combine to create a rather spontaneous story. I recommend Candide for anyone curious about this period in history and would enjoy a glimpse into the life of Candide; a young man who although faces the most unfortunate events, remains as optimistic as can be until the end. Bottom Line first: There is something presumptuous about attempting a critical review of something as classic and acclaimed as Voltaire‘s Candide. The official verdict is that this is great literature. I shall write naught to gainsay my betters. That said it can be hard for the modern reader to do better than to accept that the several hundred years of approval may not temper the problems of reading it several hundred years later. Recommendation: It may be that the best way to grasp what is a broad and darkly comic satire is the Operetta of the same name music by Lenard Bernstein and libretto by several besides Voltaire, including Lillian Hellman. Candide (1956 Original Broadway Cast)

Ok the Blah Blah Blah Part: A German natural philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1646 – 1716 argued that as God is a loving God and the maker of all things, the reality we live in the reality of choice by a loving God and therefore we live in the best of all possible worlds. The reader is advised to remember this, The Formula. The novella is a test of this conclusion. It is perhaps something of a spoiler to tell you that Voltaire is not impressed by the arguments of this philosophical polymath.

Our story opens in a palace in Westphalia, the 18th century cultural equivalent of the poorer and less desirable quarters of an unfashionable city. Here living in relative splendor of a backwater palace we find all of our major characters. Our leading male for whom the story is titled, Candide is the illegitimate son of a relative being raised among his betters including the love of his life Cunegunda. Plus various secondary characters not necessary for this discussion.

Very quickly the misadventures begin. Candide is run from his idyllic life and never again do we see the best and the balance shall be the possible. Cunegunda survives the destruction of her home and family and begins her adventures, more about anon.

Without listing the various evils and hurts our hero suffers; a few points. Everything he sees and suffers that argue against the 18th century being the best of all possible are things that actually happened. Evil is afoot in many forms often lead by seniors within the Catholic Church. Not to limit this to a shamming of the Church there is evil petty and grand from treacherous friends and servants to local politicals and businessmen. It is argued that the evil is a necessary thing to maintain a principal of proportionality but this case is made by the quickly dismissible Panglos (Pan=all Glos=talk) the broadly shamed stand-in for Leibniz.

There will be for Candide one happy interval in a land much like the Utopia dreamed up by friend to Voltaire, Thomas More. Later Candide will fall in with and benefit from friendship with cynical and more practical Martin, Martin Luther perhaps.
It is easy to fixate on the story of Candide and forget about Cunegunda. She is also subject to all of the vagaries of her sex. Instead of being sold off, I mean married off to some neighboring lordling in a commercial marriage, she is pushed in to a number of variations in the the other kinds of commerce based on young female flesh. At her side is a loyal old woman with but one buttock. Between the two we are regaled with the funny, only not so funny variations of evils set aside for 18th Century womankind.

So 75 pages of violence , treachery, petty and great wrongdoings and we are supposed to laugh? Ok maybe grim grins?
I suggest that Voltaire pretty much dismisses our magic ‘best of all possible…’ formula very quickly. The rest is a plea for tolerance and a condemnation of extremism. Especially were the most doctrinaire are also unlikely to be practicing much else that is admirable. Also the conclusion is not so much a refutation of The Formula, as it is a case for a simpler and bucolic life.

Final note on my edition. The quality of the translation is not something I can address. I can say that I liked the presence of so many extra pages of scholarly material. Buen libro. Viene bien para practicar francés I actually really enjoyed this book. I had no idea it was a comedy until I actually received it and read the back cover (I had just impulsively bought multiple books from notable authors to read to and from Europe). Despite being obviously outdated, it was pretty funny. However, you have to really have a somewhat thorough grasp of the philosophies of people like Kant and others during that time period. There are a lot of references in there that will make any philosophy major chuckle a bit. It's a super entertaining and ridiculous story that's quite unfortunate. It's a short read though and I'm glad. Any longer would just be pushing it. If you want something lighthearted and are a philosophy major or familiar with the discipline you should definitely check this book out. 著者65歳、1759年の作です。

Voltaire a beaucoup écrit. De nos jours, les contes font partie de ses œuvres les plus lues, que ce soit Candide, Zadig ou Micromégas.
En relisant ce conte que je n’avais relu depuis la classe de seconde, je me disais que décidément Voltaire eut aimé Charlie Hebdo. En effet, dès son adolescence, le jeune François-Marie Arouet, élève très intelligent, se fait remarquer par son esprit frondeur, son goût du plaisir et du bel esprit.
Ses premiers écrits satiriques lui vaudront l’exil hors de Paris. Récidiviste, il sera embastillé durant onze mois en 1717 puis en 1726. À sa sortie de prison, il s‘exile en Angleterre où il est accueilli à bras ouverts.
De retour en France en 1729, il s’attire de nouveaux ennuis par ses écrits polémiques et décide de voyager jusqu’en Prusse et en Hollande pour se faire oublier.
Voltaire finira par s’installer par mesure de sécurité à Ferney à la frontière suisse et y restera jusqu’à sa mort en 1778.
C’est en 1759 qu’est publié Candide ou L’Optimiste, un conte philosophique qui spécule sur l’origine et la signification du mal. Chaque chapitre nous découvre une nouvelle forme du mal. Et Voltaire de faire comprendre que ce ne sont pas les raisonnements métaphysiques qui mettront fin à tous ces maux. Il faut être pragmatique et les deux voies essentielles sont la retraite et le travail, résumées dans la formule : cultiver son jardin. Il faut comprendre que ce jardin que Voltaire nous invite à fertiliser est le monde dans son ensemble.
Le récit dans Candide est animé avec une alternance de moments de bonheur et de malheur et le choix de cadres exotiques pour situer toutes les aventures les plus rocambolesques et burlesques que connaissent Candide, Pangloss le philosophe, Cacambo le prudent compagnon d’aventure et plus tard Martin le sage. Sans oublier l’ineffable Cunégonde, châtelaine promise à un beau mariage, mais pour qui Candide simple citoyen va courir le monde après qu’elle avait été chassée de son château en même temps que Candide et marchandée par les envahisseurs bulgares.
On le nommait Candide car « il avait le jugement assez droit, avec l’esprit le plus simple. »
Extrait : « Un jour, Cunégonde, en se promenant auprès du château, dans le petit bois qu’on appelait parc, vit entre les broussailles le docteur Pangloss qui donnait une leçon de physique expérimentale à la femme de chambre de sa mère, une petite brune très jolie et très docile. Comme Mlle Cunégonde avait beaucoup de dispositions pour les sciences, elle observa, sans souffler, les expériences réitérées dont elle fut témoin ; elle vit clairement la raison suffisante du docteur, les effets et les causes, et s’en retourna tout agitée, toute pensive, toute remplie du désir d’être savante, songeant qu’elle pourrait bien être la raison suffisante du jeune Candide, qui pouvait être la sienne. »
Ce conte offre d’évidence un beau florilège de l’ironie voltairienne, une ironie qui sait s’attirer la sympathie du lecteur.
Toutes ces aventures vont conduire Candide et ses acolytes à visiter le monde, au Portugal, puis à Cadix, avec des moments de désespoir :
« Je voulus cent fois me tuer, mais j’aimais encore le vie. Cette faiblesse ridicule est peut-être un de nos penchants les plus funestes. »
Ensuite c’est le Paraguay et la rencontre avec les Jésuites missionnaires et l’anticléricalisme de Voltaire éclate au grand jour quand Candide découvre les jésuites aux mains des Oreillons, les sauvages du coin, qui s’écrient :
« C’est un jésuite, c’est un jésuite ! nous serons vengés, et nous ferons bonne chère ; mangeons du jésuite, mangeons du jésuite ! » Et Candide d’ajouter :
« La pure nature est bonne, puisque ces gens-ci, au lieu de me manger, m’ont fait mille honnêtetés dès qu’ils ont su que je n’étais pas jésuite. »
Puis c’est l’Eldorado, pays mythique s’il en fut, oublié par le mal qui règne de par le reste du monde, et Candide s’interroge sur leurs mœurs très curieuses :
« Quoi ! vous n’avez point de moines qui enseignent, qui disputent, qui gouvernent, qui cabalent, et qui font brûler les gens qui ne sont pas de leur avis ? »
Eldorado que Candide compare aux autres pays où « la principale occupation est l’amour, la seconde de médire, et la troisième de dire des sottises. »
Retour en Angleterre avant de partir pour Venise et Constantinople où doit se trouver finalement Cunégonde aux dernières nouvelles.
« Il est beau d’écrire ce qu’on pense : c’est le privilège de l’homme », s’exclame Pococuranté le notable vénitien.
« L’homme est né pour vivre dans les convulsions de l’inquiétude, ou dans la léthargie de l’ennui. » conclut Martin.
Et Candide : « Le travail éloigne de nous trois grands maux : l’ennui, le vice, et le besoin… Cultivons notre jardin. »

The Importance of Being Earnest (AmazonClassics Edition),"Friends Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff often need an escape from their burdensome social obligations. So Jack, who goes by Ernest in London, lives a double life, while Algy has invented an alibi: a best friend named Bumbury who is perpetually on his deathbed.
But as Jack and Algy set about wooing the objects of their affection, the inevitable unraveling of the men’s duplicity and deception threatens their happily ever afters.
In his exhilarating and subversive comedy of bizarre coincidence, disguise, and ribald misadventure, Oscar Wilde takes delight in cracking the facade that defined the civility and high-minded manners of Victorian society.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Importance of Being Earnest, this edition of The Importance of Being Earnest (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. I watched the movie years ago and forgot how entertaining and nonstop the witisims fly. A perfect pick me up. Older literature can be challenging for modern audiences to relate to, especially when it's trying to satirize elements of society at the time that may no longer be relevant. It's often still worth reading in order get a feel for the time period... and sometimes it can still be funny and even surprisingly relevant today. And such was the case with ""The Importance of Being Earnest,"" a play written by the inimitable Oscar Wilde. Just as amusing and cutting today as it was when it was first written, it's a surprisingly enjoyable jaunt that I'd love to see onstage someday.

British society men Jack and Algernon often find themselves bored by their everyday lives, and so each has their own alter ego -- Jack lives a double-life, going by Earnest while in London and Jack while visiting his home in the country, while Algernon has invented a perpetually-sick friend to serve as a handy alibi. But when two lovely women catch each man's eye -- and each lady finds themselves falling in love with the completely fictitious Earnest -- the stage is set for a comedy of errors that will find double identities exposed for all to see.

Being written in script format, it's hard to judge this by the same standards one would judge a book by. There's no real prose to judge, mainly dialogue. But in this case the dialogue is fantastic, full of witty banter and observations that do a good job at pointing out the absurdity of social mores of the time... and some social mores that continue to this day. And despite being relatively short, the play manages to spin a neat and tightly entwined plot that's satisfying -- and hilarious -- to see played out. Most of the characters seem to have the same basic personality and voice, but I can forgive this.

""The Importance of Being Earnest"" is a nicely absurd and observant play that manages to still be funny and biting over a century later. I hope to be able to see it on stage someday -- it's probably much more effective when you see it in action than read it on the page... Oscar Wilde made his initial reputation as the master of the epigram: the trenchant and mordant, roughly haiku length flashes of insight into the comic absurdity of the world. No one in English Literature before or since has ever displayed such an effortless mastery of wit. ""All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does. That's his.""

The Importance of Being Earnest not only flaunts Wilde's most inconsequential plot, it is also crammed with his funniest epigrams and wittiest bon mots. This 1895 three-act comedic tour-de-force was an immediate hit in London. The comic word-play was a sensation amongst audiences who flocked to see this brilliant manifestation of Wilde's epicene witticisms. Here was a glittering example of London's avant-garde in the 1890's. Much like the play Hair in the 1960's, it was a signature of the times that no self-respecting sophisticate could miss. Wilde enjoyed himself immensely during this apex of his fame. Unfortunately, his reputation was quickly eclipsed by the scandal that engulfed him and his work. It took several decades for that reputation to be rehabilitated. The Importance of Being Earnest seemed to float above the scandals, never losing its popularity and acquiring a theatrical life of its own as an absolutely iconic work.

This Norton Critical Edition contains an annotated version of the play as well as several brilliantly incisive articles. A few of the analysts engage in some scholarly hand-waving, trying to attribute a social commentary and literary symbolism to the play that may not exist. Some of it is quite funny, in fact. I can't help but think that Wilde would appreciate the irony of one critic portraying his comic depiction of the frequently agitated butler Lane as an assault on the English class system. Other articles are quite helpful, however. The essay by Camille Paglia is especially insightful with her brilliant analysis of Wilde's dramatic projection of an ambiguous sexual persona. It is a rare comic play that merits its own Norton Critical Edition. This is one of the few. If you love this play (and the hilarious 1951 Anthony Asquith film) as much as I do, this is the edition to have. Most strongly recommended.

Mike Birman Great book! Teaches you a lot of things you should know It’s the book I was needing. We recently saw Importance of Being Ernest in the theater. I enjoyed the witty play so much that I decided to get a copy of my own. This book contains Wilde work in the first 76% of the content, the remaining 25% is marketing material about leading a Book Club. This filler material inflated the size of the book. The filler material hides that this an abbreviated version of the book.

Ali Julia review Oscar Wilde wrote an excellent funny story. While the era covered in this book is not always easy to follow it is an enjoyable read. Just as described. Thank you! Good edition ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" von Oscar Wilde ist ein zeitloser Klassiker, der mich von Anfang bis Ende fasziniert hat. Dieses Stück ist eine brillante Satire auf die viktorianische Gesellschaft und ihre oft lächerlichen sozialen Normen. Wilde verwendet scharfen, humorvollen Dialog, um die Absurditäten des Klassenunterschieds, der Heuchelei und der Doppelmoral aufzudecken.

Die Charaktere sind unglaublich gut gezeichnet und jeder trägt auf seine Weise zum komödiantischen Charme des Stücks bei. Die beiden Protagonisten, Algernon und Jack, führen ein Doppelleben, indem sie sich jeweils als ""Ernest"" ausgeben, was zu einer Reihe von urkomischen Verwechslungen und Missverständnissen führt. Die weiblichen Charaktere, Gwendolen und Cecily, sind ebenso witzig und intelligent und halten mit den Männern locker Schritt.

Was mich besonders an diesem Stück fasziniert, ist die zeitlose Relevanz seiner Themen. Obwohl es vor mehr als einem Jahrhundert geschrieben wurde, ist seine Kritik an Oberflächlichkeit, Scheinheiligkeit und gesellschaftlicher Konvention immer noch äußerst aktuell. Die scharfsinnigen Kommentare von Wilde über die menschliche Natur und die Gesellschaft sind sowohl unterhaltsam als auch tiefgründig.

Insgesamt ist ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" ein absoluter Genuss zu lesen oder zu sehen. Es ist eine brillante Darstellung von Oscar Wildes scharfem Verstand und seiner Fähigkeit, die menschliche Natur auf humorvolle und doch treffende Weise zu analysieren. Ich kann dieses Stück jedem empfehlen, der intelligente Komödien und zeitlose Satire schätzt. Muy divertida. “All women become like their mothers. That is their tragedy. No man does, and that is his.” Cool! I’m no critic; it was very much enjoyed by me. Preso per un esame all’università ma ho voluto tenerlo perché mi è piaciuto molto"
"The Man Who Was Thursday, A Nightmare (AmazonClassics Edition)","Poet Gabriel Syme believes in the beauty of order and, as such, is recruited by Scotland Yard to an anti-anarchist police corp. While undercover, Syme meets fellow poet Lucian Gregory, a verse writer devoted to disorder, who introduces him to London’s anarchist underworld. Just as Gregory is to be elected to the central council, Syme’s cover is revealed and he is forced to make a decision that sends the cabal into chaos. Is anyone in this underground faction who or what they seem? Syme suddenly realizes he doesn’t have all the answers.
G. K. Chesterton’s masterpiece unfolds itself as a marvel of disguises: political parable, detective novel, Edwardian gothic, spy thriller, and metaphysical mystery—a byzantine maze of deception and subterfuge that surprises to this day.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Man Who Was Thursday, a nightmare, this edition of The Man Who Was Thursday, A Nightmare (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Sometimes a book will fall figuratively in your lap. My “To Read” list on Goodreads is growing faster than my “Finished” list. At some point I added G. K. Chesterton’s masterpiece – The Man Who Was Thursday – to the list, but I don’t recall why. Regardless, I was obviously in the mood for reading some early 20th century metaphysical literature chock full of allegory, metaphors, anarchists and sublime characters. (Don’t we all get that urge from time to time???)

Published in 1908, The Man Who Was Thursday begins with two men, Gabriel Syme ( a poet who believes in law and order) and Lucian Gregory, (a poet and anarchist) meeting in a garden during a party. After a lengthy discussion as to whether Man should be ruled by laws or have free will to rage against the machine, Gabriel accuses Lucian of not being a “real anarchist”. Lucian counters by inviting Gabriel to a secret meeting of anarchists to prove him wrong. At this meeting Lucian is hoping to be elected to the Supreme Council of Anarchists as “Thursday”, one of seven men on the council, each named for a day of the week. The Council, lead by the man named Sunday, is planning to carry through with a planned assassination/bombing.

What transpires next is a humorous, witty, frightening, and often philosophical look at the state of man, war, peace, God, and social order to finally reveal that nothing is as it seems.

Did I mention that the subtitle of the novel is: A Nightmare? That’s because many of the thematic discussions of the novel are pretty relevant today. Some things never change.

For fans of Christian allegory or C.S. Lewis’ Screwtape Papers, this novel will please you to no end. For fans of thought-provoking philosophical discussions that will leave you endlessly pondering the book’s meaning, this will please you to no end.

Chesterton employs subtle and not-so-subtle metaphors that leave you guessing his ultimate goal for the novel. It’s apparent right from the start: Gabriel = Law & Order. Lucian = anarchy/Free-will. Both meeting in A Garden. (I mean, c’mon!) The other members of the Council: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday et all, represent the burning questions of the time: Pessimism or optimism of Modernity; the benefits of scientific materialism; etc. And who is Sunday, the mysterious man who leads the council?

But if you think it’s just that easy, it’s not. There are enough twists and turn, colorful characters and beautiful banter that make this Nightmare a wonderful experience. This is one of those books where you will be looking up words, highlighting passages and writing notes in the margins.

Rare and wonderful is the novel that comes along that, after reading the last word, instantly bestows upon you the desire to read it again. The Man Who Was Thursday is just such a novel.

While some of the events and situations may seem out of date, the novel will certainly provoke further discussion. Want to have fun? Suggest this for your next Book Club read and watch the sparks fly….

5 out of 5 Stars The Man Who Was Thursday was a worthy return for me to the fiction genre...my initial appeal came from the identity of the writer (Chesterton), who was also a Christian theologian and author, perhaps best known for his work, Orthodoxy (also on my reading list). My interest was piqued immediately by the minimalist background and intriguing checkmate between the first two characters he quickly and unexpectedly developed. Throughout, the writing is skillful, descriptive, symbolic, yet accessible. It was enjoyable and stimulating to see an artist use words to paint pictures of all sorts in a way rarely deployed in non-fiction, and certainly not used in much of the technical material I read. I think his flourish infected how I wrote this review!!

Without giving away the story or its conclusion, be prepared for many an unforeseen twist throughout the ever rapidly accelerating chaos of the drama. Although written in 1908, some of the themes could easily find their parallel developing in my imagination as I considered the unknown anarchist plots of the 21st century. When done, i recommend scanning the book in retrospect to see how the plot foreshadows the culmination, looking for both the obvious as well as the subtle messages in this ""Nightmare.""

The only critique I offer is the relatively consistent cursing in the dialogue as tension mounts. This was particularly troubling to me in light of Chesterton's profession of following Christ. I understand that, in the English culture of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, though, that these common words which we consider ""mild profanity"" we're analogous to my own use of words such as ""darn"" or ""heck."" Assuming that's true, I offer this only as a caution so that the reader realizes what he will see, and also pray that we in the 21st century don't misinterpret this as evidence supporting a faithful believer failing to police his own words, for as Jesus said, it is what comes out of a person that defiles him because it reveals the condition of his heart. Ótimo livro; fácil de ler e difícil de interpretar, como são muitos textos profundos. Pode, como todos os grandes livros, ser relido muitas vezes ao longo da vida, com intervalos de vários anos (por exemplo) e não perderá sua atratividade. Já o conhecia como livro de papel; comprei o e-book para tê-lo sempre comigo... Brilliant Book. Super Print Quality I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I started reading this, but it definitely wasn't what I got! This is an extremely well-written, very witty, with endless neat turns of phrases and observations, tale of what are essentially a group of terrorists who aim to ""destroy God"" and reduce mankind to anarchy. The terrorists are all named after days of the week with the terrible Sunday being the avenging angel who oversees all of the other weekday's activities. There are more twists and turns than a Victorian London street and nothing is ever quite what you expect in the story. This was published in 1905 but is surprisingly still very relevant today. In this age where we are all fearing where the next extremist suicide bomber is going to strike with his own ideas of destroying the western version of God, Sunday's dreadful intention to annihilate mankind does not seem all that far-fetched. The only difference is that instead of FBI car chases, and shootouts, what we have are chases conducted by men in top hats and tails with the aid of hansom cabs, hot air balloons stolen from the Great Exhibition and, notably a stolen elephant from the zoological gardens. The weapon of choice seems to be a duelling sword although some pistols do get drawn. This is a great book and it's FREE to download on Kindle - can't go wrong. interessant Great book. Was fun to read from start to finish. A wild, philosophical, metaphysical, thrilling ride. It's like a mixture between kafka and lewis carroll, but with chesterton's wit."
To the Lighthouse (AmazonClassics Edition),"On the glistening surface of Virginia Woolf’s groundbreaking novel is the Ramsay family, a seemingly stable group of characters, but a group that is ultimately subject to the same alterations and losses that come with the passing of time. Set at the Ramsays’ summerhouse over two September days, ten years apart, Woolf’s influential landmark of twentieth-century literature explores the hopes, frustrations, and small moments of grace and change that permeate everyday life. First published in 1927, To the Lighthouse provides a quintessentially modernist, kaleidoscopic focus on the characters’ interior lives, but it also offers an enduringly wise and sensitive portrayal of human fragility. In Woolf’s novel, the absurdity, mundanity, and tenuousness of human life is uniquely evident—and uniquely beautiful as a result.
Revised edition: Previously published as To the Lighthouse, this edition of To the Lighthouse includes editorial revisions. This work is surgery of the emotions and intellectual aspects of men and women at a time that strangely echoes our times with its similarities and compels us deeper with its differences. It is a masterful work of wonder on the human mind and the wills and secret power that pushes us to be who we are and do what we do in life. Virginia knows how to read the human mind like a book and show it to us plainly. Avoid this. So many mistakes made by whichever non-native speaker typed this as to be unreadable. Glaring misuse of pronouns, dropped words, and poor mechanics-- pages don't open easily. Impossible to follow. Nonostante fosse un libro usato,si presenta come nuovo,sembra non essere stato mai letto.È arrivato velocemente.Sono veramente soddisfatta e penso di ordinarne altri. well organised and clear information This particular edition is riddled with errors to the point of being ruined. Avoid."
The Conjure Woman (AmazonClassics Edition),"A northern white couple has relocated to the South to operate a vineyard on a North Carolina plantation. There, they pass their idle hours listening to the stories of one Uncle Julius, who has a deep knowledge of the land. These stories, however, are more than mere entertainments. They all have their time and place, and they offer not only a quiet commentary on the events of the day but also a deeper reckoning with the plantation’s disturbing past.
First published in 1899, this collection of stories introduced Charles W. Chesnutt to the public as a spinner of fantastical conjure tales. Exploring Southern folklore and supernaturalism and offering a subversive challenge to white authority, they are now regarded as preeminent works of African American literature.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Conjure Woman, this edition of The Conjure Woman (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. So interesting to read some of the varieties of the live of slaves. So many had sad lives filled with hard work, the anger of their masters. Others were able to adapt or had good masters. But all lacked their freedom and all had amazing stories to tell. This book shared several of these tales in such an intriguing way, that I totally enjoyed this book. Great book...I listen to the Audio while i tead for the dialect part Chestnutt was a pioneer of African American fiction, and as such, his fiction has been under many critical eyes. I myself found the vernacular difficult, but of course, that's part of the point. Chestnutt wanted not only to tell his stories, but to do so successfully and in a way that would appeal to the largest reading audiences, which were, at the time, white people. Under pressure from his white publisher, many of his stories were edited to be less inflammatory to white readers. However, you can still find double meaning in much of Chestnutt's prose, especially when we focus on the perceptions of the white ""protagonist"" who parades as Chestnutt's main character while ultimately providing but a mere rhetorical frame for Chestnutt's real focus: Uncle Julius. While I tend to prefer mid-to-late 20th and 21st Century narratives (which is why I rate the book four stars), Chestnutt and his influence on African American storytelling cannot be understated. Revealing, entertaining, and educational. Allows reader to enter centuries past. This book is representative of its time. It is important to note that racism was more overt in the late 19th century, and it was only a few decades after slavery. However, I was disappointed that a Black writer created Uncle Julius to be a Sambo character. I found this book to be interesting and a good read. It is not modern and that is perfectly okay. Highly recommend if interested in conjure or historical fiction Insightful, good read It is soooo funny and entertaining. Although the stories are nonsensical, I recommend this book. Julius is a great storyteller and a great character. well written, interesting story. I couldn't put it down."
Tristram Shandy (AmazonClassics Edition),"Beginning with the events leading up to his conception, Tristram Shandy intends to grace readers with his remarkable life story. But his words often run wild. And through two expansive arcs—marvels of incident—so does his narrative, chockablock with family, friends, chambermaids, midwives, parsons, guardians, and neighbors. For the defensive Tristram, marshaling his material becomes something of a wonderful struggle with every new digression.
Defiantly original, deliberately playful, and an absurd celebration of writing, Tristram Shandy’s progressive experimental structure divided critics, delighted readers, and exerted an influence on generations of writers. Today, Laurence Sterne’s tour de force is universally lauded as a milestone in metafictional narrative.
Revised edition: Previously published as Tristram Shandy, this edition of Tristram Shandy (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Read by Thomas Jefferson and his wife. Very funny and enjoyable. Doesn’t require being brainy This is an autobiography of Tristram Shandy, with most about what happened before he was born. Reads incredibly well, and easy for a book from the 1700's. Lots of metafiction, conversational engagement features. Erudite vocabulary. Tongue in cheek humor. I read the Rowson graphic novel version first to get the overview. I was expecting it to be difficult, like Shakespeare, but the prose was surprisingly modern. Sterne's style was modern, pleasant, and clever. The narrator, Lesser, did a great job. He gets the emotions and the jokes. arrived sooner than expected and in perfect condition I bought this kindle ebook confidently because it was a Penguin edition - and, I'm not gonna lie, the price was great too - but I was very disappointed. I'm a literature student, and I found it difficult for literature students as well as non-students to have a complete and successful reading.
The novel is excellent, but it is also form the XVIII century, and a reader today needs a lot of information that is not covered in the footnotes. The footnotes only translate phrases in other languages - latin, french, etc. - (however, there is a whole passage around three pages long in french that they don't translate), or are the footnotes written by Sterne himself, which obviously don't explain us his historical context. I would have expected to find in this footnotes historical context or explanations, as well as notes regarding some XVIII Century vocabulary, idioms, expressions, etc. I thought that with a Penguin edition I would have a more complete reading, but I think it would have been almost the same if I had downloaded from the Internet a free copy (like in Project Gutenberg) since this annotated edition offers no great help. Anton Lessor gives a performance worthy of this classic. I am writing a paper on Tristram Shandy for school and thought, hey, what the heck I'll listen to it in my car. Walter Shandy and Uncle Toby are characters that rank with Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The phrasing and nuance that Lessor gives to Shandy actually provides more humour than you might find on your own. Your get the benefit of someone who has read the material several times and knows where all the jokes are, so you can benefit the first time around. Thoroughly professional preparation is demonstrated by Lessor. When Sterne writes --- or *** just what is a voice actor supposed to do? Somehow Lessor makes a great decision almost every time. That is what I mean when I say it is funnier than reading it on your own. Uncle Toby and Walter talking about ""the right end of a woman"" is priceless.
By the way, the service from England by mail is pretty good, so save some money and buy it from one of the third party vendors. Enjoy. This book cannot be read w/o a powerful magnifying glass as the font size is miniscule. No publisher should EVER produce a book with this small of a font size; this is a ridiculous edition of the book. It was returned for a refund. When Laurence Sterne, in 1760 wrote the first volume of TRISTRAM SHANDY in what was to be a series of nine, no one had any idea what this new genre of literature was meant to be. The only models that Sterne had were Henry Fielding and Samuel Richardson, so the field was pretty much wide open in terms of any competitor's choice of content, style, or theme. Sterne noted from these two that their successes were based on their characters' being placed in wildly varying and potentially threatening situations. He took these twin concepts of changeable location and possible harm which he incorporated into the first volume of Tristram Shandy, and then proceeded to turn the incipient world of novel writing over on its very young head. What differentiated this book from those of Fielding and Richardson was Sterne's abandoning the tidy world of the classical insistence on the need for unity. In a style that centuries later would be adopted by Joyce and Proust, Sterne twisted the relation between plot and time into a pretzel. To begin with, the title itself is a misnomer. The titular hero, Tristram, is not even born until midway through the book. He is born, appears briefly, disappears for lengthy periods of time, and then reappears briefly at the end. A more honest title would have been ""The Life and Times of the Father and Uncle of Tristram Shandy."" It is Walter Shandy, Tristram's father and Toby Shandy, the uncle, who dominate most of the action. And it is not simply a misdirection of who the primary protagonist is to be that gives TRISTRAM SHANDY its off beat flavor. What distinguishes this book from both its predecessors and most of its descendants is Sterne's refusal to use structured time as the unifying glue.

When Sterne presents his action in a manner that seems to defy the laws of causality in that results may precede causes, he does so by his novel use of the association of ideas which act to reconnect threads of thought that are snipped here and spliced there. Such cycles of snipping and splicing lead to digressions such as when in Volume II, the removal of Walter Shandy's wig leads his brother to be reminded of military tactics from his participation in a long past war. Such digressions take on a life of their own, like baby universes after the Big Bang with each one branching off to a possibly related clone. Sterne asks a lot of his readers to tolerate these rapid and often extended shifts in time and perspective. For those readers who are nimble enough of mind to follow, they are treated to some very comic scenes of humor that range from the broadest of satire to the most scatological of coarse jesting. By the time that Tristram makes his initial appearance, the reader has already learned to anticipate the many detours (some would call them roadblocks) of time and space that Sterne has inserted. Many of these scenes of digressive humor are so bizarre and pathetic, that the reader is not sure whether he should laugh or cry. And that perhaps is the magic that causes each new generation of readers to return and follow the twisted paths of time and space that even now can wring tears and laughs from them, sometimes in the same breath. I won't review the book because plenty of others have done so. I will merely comment that the product information is messed up. The book I received is not the edition pictured. It also has lots of dirty finger prints all over it even though it is supposed to be new, shipped and sold by Amazon. DIeses Buch zu bewerten ist nicht einfach. Sagen wir mal so: Es ist viel leichter zu lesen, als Gargantua und Pantagruel von Rabelais, in dessen Geiste es wohl geschrieben ist. Und das Werk ist wirklich unglaublich witzig! Ich hatte von dem Autor nie etwas gehört, bis ich (ich weiß nicht mehr wo) von Arthur Schopenhauer diesen Buchtipp erhalten habe. Schopenhauer war voll des Lobes und das ist schon was Besonderes.
Der Autor ist heute vielleicht schon vom Vergessen bedroht. Mein Tipp: Lest nicht, was euch Goethe und Schiller empfehlen (wie den unsagbar langweiligen Goldsmith). Hört auf Schopenhauer und lest dieses Buch! 👌 Inútil I consider this Very expensive for a dozen plus plastic discs, but I also consider this book to be one of the best ever written, and this reading of it is superb. If you do not know the book, Sterne crams an entire (and complete) universe into pages of text, delivering a spectrum of the experience of being a human being that is wider than any other work of fiction. Beware though, if you are one who wants a plot in a story, a direction in a character's actions, or a book to ""get on with it"" you will get NONE of it from Tristram Shandy. Not only that you will be be frustrated and irritated. But if you want joyous, humourous, and subtle episodes of life depicted which say more about humanity than you can imagine being able to be said, you will get ALL of it and MORE. It is read wonderfully, with an obvious sparkle in the eye and fast but clear pronunciation. It is Very Expensive for what it is, but once you start to listen to it you will not mind. Three thumbs up. I thoroughly enjoyed this fantastic book full of wit and mirth. While it was not an easy read I was greatly assisted by Anton Leader's brilliant narration for which he has earned my undying gratitude. Bravo"
The Pickwick Papers (AmazonClassics Edition),"Samuel Pickwick, founder and chairman of the Pickwick Club, engages three fellow members to accompany him on a journey. By coach they’ll travel to the outreaches of London to explore, observe, and report back on the quaint wonders of the English countryside. What transpires is a picaresque romp of misadventures, hair-raising challenges, and romantic follies entangling the fates of a riot of colorful characters—a passel of villains, spinsters, poets, and sportsmen—and the unworldly Pickwick himself, who has much to learn about life outside his gentleman’s club.
At once a slapstick farce and whip-smart social satire, Charles Dickens’s debut was a publishing phenomenon that catapulted its author into inimitable fame.
Revised edition: Previously published as The Pickwick Papers, this edition of The Pickwick Papers (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Charles Dickens wrote The Pickwick Papers in his early 20s, but the writing is first rate and as witty as any seasoned author could have done in his place! Like many of Dickens's works, Pickwick was published in monthly installments, or ""numbers"" as they were called then. Although Dickens originally intended to end the story at the twentieth number, the popularity of the series (and the resultant income) convinced Dickens to double the length to forty numbers. The end result is a large offering that'll take you a while to get through (~750 pages in the excellent Penguin edition, which I read).
Despite its length, Pickwick never tries your patience. It's delightfully humorous from beginning to end. Samuel Pickwick is the bumbling, middle-aged, wealthy namesake of this novel. He's the leader of a small group of single men that gets into all sorts of mischief, both physical and social. Booze is rampant. Apparently liquor back then was much more a part of daily life than today; everywhere these guys go they party and get drunk. They get into trouble with the law, women, unsavory characters, and more.
Characterization is superb. This is one of the few novels I've read for which I can actually say that I got to know the characters. In most books I've read, the characters remain two-dimensional and the plot is what carries the story. In Pickwick, the *characters* are the essence of the story and the novel wouldn't be memorable at all if a lesser author were attempting to breathe life into these people.
The Penguin edition includes a decent collection of endnotes to help explain unfamiliar portions of the text. Nevertheless, there were still quite a few words and concepts peculiar to early 19th century England that I didn't grasp. This edition also has maps of southern England and a key to the specific locations that the Pickwickians visit. In addition, two appendices reprint some of the announcements and prefaces that Dickens wrote in relation to the work.
Highly recommended, particularly if you enjoy classic literature! Dickens's later works overshadow this gem due to their maturity, but Pickwick beats them all in enthusiasm, humor, and wit. Readers new to Dickens should be aware that 'The Pickwick Papers' is, in some ways, not a particularly 'Dickensian' book. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I should like to dispose of some of the most obvious objections - forewarned is, after all, forearmed.

Firstly, for the purposes of the casual reader, the prose style still reeks of the nineteenth century parliamentary and court reporter that he was before this, his first long work of fiction, was published. This can variously be viewed as enjoyably quaint, frustratingly gratuitous or simply incomprehensible. Half a page should suffice for the potential buyer to discover which way they will take it. Secondly, this is a book where nothing very much actually happens and that which does happen is generally ridiculous and inconsequential. I strongly suspect Dickens had some of the picaresque novels of his own literary heroes firmly in mind as he bent to each serial instalment, a cheap and nasty publishing method which negatively effected the quality and integrity of all but a handful of his works.

Now to the good stuff. The lack of a plot is, as anyone familiar with Dickens will probably agree, a bit of a blessing in disguise. We do not have to struggle to remember characters who triumphantly unmask themselves after first appearing in disguise in some trivial incident buried unmemorably between bouts of low comedy. We are not required to strain our credulity at shocking co-incidences (much) or bizzare wills or motives. We are left free to enjoy the brilliant, fecund riot of spontaneous creation that is what makes Dickens an enduring miracle of English prose. Characters of such vivid and memorable form that, more than a hundred years on, the cigarette cards they were pictured on are still readily recognisable to anyone who has met them in print. And Dickens' England, a sort of neo-mediaeval, pre-industrial idyll, is one of my favourite places to go. Incidentally, this work was reportedly Tolstoy's favourite bedside book, so we travel in good company.

Dickensian moral and social outrage is in full force here as well, as he rails against false charity, debtors prisons and charlatans of every stamp, rounding it all off with a dose of genuine compassion and forgiveness for the repenting sinner. At times sickeningly sentimental, but never dull, this book is a delight. Do yourself a favour and take an uncomplicated, cheerful walk through the English countryside and spend some time with its broad-waisted, narrow-minded, but ultimately big hearted denizens. Also, look out for what is arguably Dickens' finest creation - the irrepressible cockney everyman, Sam Weller.

It is, however, important to keep in mind when this book was written. Political correctness should be left at the title page - I have never read a feminist review of Dickens that showed the slightest ability to see past the patriarchal reality in which he lived. If one wishes to understand him, I think it is best to accept the political world that he lived in as uncritically as he did himself. I grabbed this edition (green cover, copy of the original print edition) because it was free, but I am fortunate to have a very, very old print edition (predates ISBNs, described as the Dickens' best edition) . . . so old that the pages are extremely fragile. This has given me the best of both worlds, as I can read the text on my Kindle but compare the illustrations with the print edition. Print does justice to the engravings, while the digital format just can't compare. Background details are often lost, and the captions are omitted.

The illustrations are of paramount importance, since the original plan was to hire Dickens to write sketches to accompany the illustrations, based on the success of his ""Sketches by Boz."" It was a fortunate choice for posterity, if not for the original illustrator, but the illustrations do matter.

While most of the illustrations appear in both my print edition and the digital edition, each has some illustrations that are unique to it. Aside from the quality of the reproduction in digital format, the Kindle edition often tucks the illustrations far from the chapter it was intended to illustrate (most appear in later chapters, but occasionally one will appear before the scene it describes).

The digital edition also omits the preface Charles Dickens wrote for the first post-serial publication. It's worth reading, although Wikipedia gives a fuller account of the dispute over the illustrations versus the text. Loved this book for years! My favourite Dickens novel. Chockful of funny stories, warm affection and a glimpse of all walks of life of those times. The latest Penguin Classics, with the white lettering instead of the orange, are much worse in quality. Luckily this Dickens classic isn't reprinted yet Compré este libro porque su contenido. Describe escenas costumbristas. A pesar de su mediocridad Dickens escribía relatos para la prensa. Conectores, adverbios, giros lingüísticos empleados en cada concreto contexto.

Valoro positivamente la edición. Es un libro subrayable: tamaño folio, 383 páginas sin índice, prólogo ni ilustraciones, papel grueso no satinado. Es un libro para aprender inglés. Dickens é um supernarrador, como comprova este que é o seu primeiro romance. As histórias de Pickwick e dos pickwickianos revela sua capacidade de criar enredos e personagens que ganham vida e nunca mais nos abandonam. Aqui, particularmente, a narrativa traz o magnífico humor britânico. One of Dickens' lesser read works perhaps however one of his most outstanding contributions to classic English literature. A read for all ages from young to old."
Darkwater: Voices from within the Veil (AmazonClassics Edition),"In this ambitious—even radical—literary collection, first published in 1920, civil rights leader W. E. B. Du Bois tackled race, gender, art, politics, labor, and economics from the perspective of an African American who, in his own words, had “been in the world, but not of it.”
Du Bois took an experimental approach in Darkwater—utilizing essays, poetry, spirituals, sketches, and autobiographical writings—to break new ground on issues of race, class, and prejudice that continue to confound us. These are deep meditations, based on years of introspection and observation, but their cumulative effect goes beyond mere philosophy: it builds to a clear demand for justice and equality. Du Bois was a leading thinker on these questions throughout his life, but Darkwater stands as one of his most expansive and prophetic calls to action.
Revised edition: Previously published as Darkwater, this edition of Darkwater (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. ""Darkwater Vocies"" is a collection of of assorted poetry, essays, an individual profile, and a short story authored by W. E. B. Du Bois in 1920. I thoroughly enjoyed this work for a variety of reasons.

Doctor Du Bois is the first African American to have been awarded a Doctorate from Harvard. He was a very prominent voice from the then segregated African American Community. He authored a variety of writings exploring all aspects of American Society including, of course, race relations. One of his other most famous works is a book, ""The Souls of Black Folk"" which I have previously studied.

This particular collection being reviewed includes an autobiography, a collection of essays and poetry. My two favorite works within this collection are the profile of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and a fictional short story; ""The Comet"". Doctor Du Bois is a very important individual in African American history. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor is British and an important figure in the history of Pan Africanism. Both of these individuals are worthy of study for anyone interested in African American history and Pan Africanism.

""The Comet"" is also a very intework. I am currently in quarantine or social isolation concerning the Covid Virus. The situation caused me to contemplate a movie I had seen in the past, ""The World, The Flesh, and The Devil"" from 1959. I rewatched that movie and studied it. There was a reference to the short story ""The Comet"". This short story is contained within this work. While neither the movie nor this short story is really the same as the situation our country faces right now, I feel there are vague similarities. I also feel that the movie and the short story are both a very interesting pair of works for the purposes of comparing and contrasting.

In summary I ccompletely completely enjoyed this work. I was able to download this work for free on Kindle and I am very grateful. This work is a very interesting collection and provides illumination on the social situation in America just after World War I. Additionally, the comparison between ""The Comet"" and ""The World, The Flesh, and The Devil"", although not an actual part of this work, is of particular interest to me. Thank You... This is a wonderful book of philosophy, truth, and very in depth of many subjects. I love to read Dr.Du Bois he was a very intelligent, insightful, courageous and kind human being. Great Book!! Dr. DuBois was in his prime in terms of thinking and formulating just Brilliant ideas on Racism in early part of the 20th Century. This book should be read by all Afrikan Peoples! Provides amazing insight into the political, social, and cultural world of circa 1910 America and the world. I was fascinated by the similarities between Due Bois' observations on his times and my views of contemporary America. The more things change the more they remain the same. Dubois never failed to deliver the most cogent arguments within an awe-inspiring prose. He is, through his works, an immortal intellectual. Dr. Dubois provides an introspective analysis of a denied reality. Seeing through his eyes is wise. An amazing legacy - required reading for history buffs I expected something of history, which it has, but the way it is presented is totally different than I expected and requires more attention and thought than most I have read. SO glad I read it."
The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar (AmazonClassics Edition),"The first African American poet to achieve international fame, Paul Laurence Dunbar used his prodigious literary gifts to chronicle and celebrate Black life as he saw it. He utilized both traditional poetic forms and contemporary dialect in a range of styles—lyrical, conversational, and playful—as diverse as his themes. This collection, containing the entirety of Dunbar’s poetry, captures his still vital expressions of love, work, and family. It also serves as a revelatory expression of Dunbar’s frustrations with racial injustice and oppression.
Joyous, mournful, firmly grounded, yet transcendent, Dunbar’s inventive work has been cited as a major influence by many contemporary poets.
Revised edition: Previously published as Lyrics of Lowly Life, Lyrics of the Hearthside, Humor and Dialect, Lyrics of Love and Laughter, Lyrics of Love and Sorrow, Lyrics of Sunshine and Shadow, this edition of The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Paul Laurence Dunbar has been too much overlooked! His brilliance should have been enshrined within the educational curriculum of all education. He combines, humour, practicality, familiarity, tolerance, despair - almost every possible human emotion could be identified within his work. Despite my love of poetry to have been British educated as I was without Mr. Dunbar's work being brought before me until late adulthood, I feel has been a wrong done both to Mr. Dunbar's excellence and to me in the loss of years of entertainment. One of my favourites, ""The Lawyers' Ways"" is hilarious plus the simplicity of presentation as though truly puzzled by the wiles of the law, is enchanting. Another captures the sadness, the desperation, the lack of home in ""Life"" my favourite line """"And never a laugh but the moans come double; And that is life!"" Who has suffered that cannot identify with that line?!
Even in his writing, the novel ""The Uncalled"", was just unbelievable; he captured the hypocritical religiosity of those who would presume to be the judge of human behaviour - e.g. sitting on the pulpit as though it were the Throne of God meting out justice on transgressors. Yet he also captured the eternal hope within the human spirit and the resignation to unpleasant circumstances that might plague some of our existence. The storyline itself is quite surprising with respect to the perspective from which the author approaches and shares his observations. In its introduction, some of those observations brought to my mind E.F. Benson's ""Mapp and Lucia"" although, Mr. Dunbar's observations the reader discovers are not given to the tolerance of the former nor the semi-amusement the characters could engender during a different age and place (being 1930s for the former as opposed to 1890s ref the latter). That is no fault of the author's but I digress as this review is about Mr. Dunbar's collected works and NO-ONE could be amiss in purchasing this collection for their library. It is a MUST HAVE, if you like poetry and a MUST HAVE if you wish to expand your education and a MUST HAVE for anyone who can appreciate anything of art and literature. I love , love this historical African American author. He is truly my favorite author. If and When Melindy Sings, I know by memory. Each time I read from The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar my face and heart are in total eclipse. I am so thankful for this legacy of Mr Dunbar. He has provided joy for generations before me and I believe forever others will continue to be amazed at his talent. My only regret is that I never will meet him in this life. Such a brilliant man before my time. He makes me so proud of my own roots. I would still like to thank him although, I am at a loss for words to express how thankful and proud he makes me feel. So on that final note, I will just say thank you and when I meet you in the eternal life, I'd like to know a little more about, That ""gread big pahty down to Tom's de othah night."" I love Mr Dunbar. One day we will talk forever. A good read. Recommend to read, if you are interested in. His sorrow, joy, his religion, love, especially his fleeting short feelings on music ^^ From the time that I was a little girl, I have been exposed to the beautiful work of this gifted poet, and I was pleased to find a full and complete copy of his work, not just the poetry that was written in the dialect of the African living in America, but also his sonnets -- which are every bit as beautiful and important as those of William Shakespeare. I rated the book on the basis of its content, which is complete. The presentation does not do justice to the work inside, thus a four-star rating. Were the book beautifully bound, and the paper of better quality -- then it would have been five stars for me. But buy the book, anyway. The content is exquisite and a true representation of the African peoples living in America, and, how they communicated with one another, done with humor and love. This humble black man, a rare scholar who was in the same Ohio high school class as Orville Wright, produced fine poetry in two idioms throughout his grief, poverty, and illness- wracked lifetime, the idioms being standard English and Black patois. His productivity was great, and the quality, in my judgment, very good. I admit I have a special appreciation for the poetry in patois. While his life was difficult and saddening, his poetry was often merry. AAH, the talent of this man!!Of all the poems he has written, the one that moved me the most was ""The Colored Soldiers"". ""the noble sons of Ham, the gallant colored soldiers, Who fought for Uncle Sam"". Early in the war they were scorned,and when ""distress fell on the nation, and the flag was drooping low"", these brave black men did not want the flag polluted by dust,so they joined the battle, shedding their blood right along with the white soldiers. ""they were comrades then and brothers, are they more or less today?"" Dunbar felt their blood ""has cleansed completely, every blot of slavery's shame"" No Mr. Dunbar, your poetic wish is a dream many americans still hold dear. In poetry,Dunbar captures elusive emotions,wraps them around a verse, then records them for posterity. This should be required reading for every student. I am so glad I was able to read this book, written by a man who was years ahead of his time I enjoyed the book, however found it difficult at times to interpret the vernacular. Had to spend a little more time in reading over the verses. I was familiar with several of the poems before hand. It's astonishing how a person could create so many thoughtful poems in such a short lifetime.Most of them have a sadness about them. But given the era in which Dunbar lived, it's quite understanding. I will be using some of Dunbar's poems to teach my 3rd and 6 grade granddaughter's in homeschool. It's never too early to understand one's history So many poems. A great collection of poems by a great poet in a large but lightweight book. This economy edition doesn't have the frills of the more expensive hardback, but the content is outstanding. Poems telling the story of an oppressed culture. Sometimes shocking. Sometimes emotional. Always descriptive and illuminating. Paul Laurence Dunbar deserves much wider recognition. lovely poems The print is very pale almost faded looking.
The font style is odd and the size smaller than expected.

Overall, the poor quality of the print belies the claim to being of 'high quality'.

Nevertheless am a fan of Dunbar's writing."
Cane (AmazonClassics Edition),"A striking mosaic of prose, poetry, and dramatic dialogue, Jean Toomer’s Cane has come to be considered a masterpiece of the Harlem Renaissance. Structured as a series of vignettes ripe with longing, passion, violence, and revenge, the haunting novel gives a powerful voice to the interior lives of African Americans in the rural South and urban North.
Championed for its unsparing honesty and psychological insight by such luminaries as Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, Alice Walker, and Maya Angelou, Cane shines as a beacon to generations of African American writers who followed.
Revised edition: Previously published as Cane, this edition of Cane (AmazonClassics Edition) includes editorial revisions. Jean Toomer (1894-1967) was a writer bundled with a host of seeming contradictions. He was heralded as part of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, but he never wanted to be considered a Black writer, preferring to be called an American writer. He changed his name at least twice; born Nathan Pinchback Toomer, his maternal grandfather called him Eugene after his father (also a Nathan) abandoned the family. When he began his writing career and for 20 years after, he used the name “Jean Toomer,” changing it again to Nathan Jean Toomer.

He wrote movingly of Black people, yet both of his parents were of mixed race. His mother’s family were free before the Civil War; his father was born into slavery but raised by his white grandfather. Toomer married twice, both wives were white. He seems never to have called himself either Black or white, saying that he was simply an American.

He wrote poetry, one work of fiction, and several non-fiction books, but it is his work of fiction for which he’s best known and remembered.

“Cane” was published in 1923 and immediately recognized as a great modernist achievement. It appears to be a collection of several short stories, separated by poems and short sketches. The short stories concern several women – Karintha, Becky, Carma, Fern, Esther, Louisa, Avey, Muriel, and Bona. A long story, entitled “Kabnis,” concludes the work. The settings move from rural and small-town Georgia to Northern cities. Only gradually does the reader come to understand that all of these stories, poems, and sketches are connected. Reading “Cane” is like reading William Faulkner, the modernist author with whom Toomer is often favorably compared. (Faulkner and Toomer were roughly contemporaries.) This is a work about Black women, Black men, the post-Civil War era in the South, and the great migration to the North, which was fully underway when Toomer began writing.

Toomer said he was influenced by Sherwood Anderson’s “Winesburg, Ohio” (also a cycle of short stories) and “The Waste Land” by T.S. Eliot. To read Cane is to experience a full range of emotions – wonder, surprise, understanding, disgust, anger, love, and affection are a few. Through the short stories, poems, and sketches, the author is telling a story about how individual people experienced some of the most tumultuous events in their history. This history is familiar to all of us; how these individuals experienced is not.

Beehive

Within this black hive to-night
There swarm a million bees;
Bees passing in and out the moon,
Bees escaping out the moon,
Bees returning through the moon,
Silver bees intently buzzing,
Silver honey dripping from the swarm of bees.
Earth is a waxen cell of the world comb,
And I, a drone,
Lying on my back,
Lipping honey,
Getting drunk with silver honey,
Wish that I might fly out past the moon
And curl forever in some far-off farmyard flower.

A number of books have been published that provide more information, research, and literary study about Toomer and his work. “The Collected Poems of Jean Toomer” (1988) is the only volume of his poetry. “Invisible Darkness: Jean Toomer and Nella Larson” (1993) is a study of two figures of the Harlem Renaissance. “Jean Toomer: Race, Repression, and Revolution” by Barbara Foley (2104) examines his interest in class struggle. “Jean Toomer: Selected Essays and Criticism” was published in 1996. Numerous editions of “Cane” have been published, including teaching guides and literary criticisms.

“Cane” is almost 100 years old. It’s known among academics, but it deserves to have a wider readership beyond being considered a modernist classic. The stories often startle; they use language that would rarely be used today. But they open a window into a time and how people lived in that time and through that time, how they were shaped and shaped themselves. I'm no scholar on Jean Toomer or the Harlem Renaissance, but was interested in Cane due to Toomer's ""Portage Experiment"" along with his Gurdjeiff years, so my reading of the book was to try to find a glimpse into the man he would be roughly ten years later, a man strongly desiring to leave race behind him - and to get the country to follow him. Cane is, of course, not an autobiography, but like all works of art, is an expression of the artist. The language moves from poetry to almost scholarly observations, and is replete with imagery and intensity. It is easy to see why the book was so critically acclaimed and also why so few people at the time were interested in reading it. It was wonderfully crafted, yet challenged far too many personal views. For whatever else he was, it seems to me that Jean Toomer was a man ahead of his time - even ahead of our time in many ways - and it is interesting that even in this edition the afterword is still concerned with Toomer's race, the very same question that made Toomer walk away from Cane. Yes, it IS a book steeped in the question of race...absolutely. But, in the years of our ""first Black president"" - whose parentage is half-black and half-white - I wonder how much ""black blood"" one must have to be black? All? Half? A quarter? And what is the racist view? If a white person says someone with any Black ancestry is Black, what is that to mean? If a black person says the same thing, does it mean a different thing? To be 1/8th black is to be black? To be 1/16th Cherokee is to be Native American? And who is defining these views and for what purpose? What is FUBU? Does it tear down walls or build them? The biases go both ways, of course. But I digress...yet in this is to understand Jean Toomer's struggle to try to help define our country's ""us"" as ALL of us. He is still ahead of our time. Read the book. Toomer's prose and poetry is quite pretty. It's easy to see why it's a classic. He, himself, is an interesting character and I've been researching his story so I thought I'd take a look at his writing. Glad I did. How does one offer criticism of a classic? The poetry was beautiful and vivid. The short shorties, not so much. There were a few I throughly enjoyed but anyone expecting the romance of Hurston or the storytelling of Hughes will be greatly disappointed. Toomer is in a category all his own and for me, that wasn't a good thing. Many will love it and have, I wasn't one of them. However, if you are a poetry lover, it's worth the read. Cane, by Jean Toomer, is the most interesting and best-written book that came out of the so-called, ""Harlem Renaissance."" The series of insightful vignettes that make up the book are fascinating. Five Stars. I love Jean Toomer and the other Harlem Renaissance writers. Cane depicts various stories through the rural South and is also sympathetic toward its subjects. The book was great because I needed it as a reference for a presentation on Jean Toomer for my African American Literature course. The book included his army records, birth and marriage certificates, childhood photos, and background on his family. This is a really great book and I enjoyed it so much. Reading it was fun and reading about it was just as great. I got it to do an essay on for University and it was one of my favorite books to read, and I have read a lot as an English major student. I highly recommend to anyone interested in African American studies.

The quality of the book, upon arrival, was very decent for the price. No scratches, no wear or tear. Overall very happy with the product and delivery time. Just masterpiece . On level of ""Mullato"" by Langston Hughes and other Harlem Renaissance writers. (Countee Cullen, McKay).
Very interesting form- short stories, poems, and sketches connected together in one sensitive stream. impeccable"
