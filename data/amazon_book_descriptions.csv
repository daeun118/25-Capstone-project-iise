The Tell-Tale Heart and Other Stories (AmazonClassics Edition),"Edgar Allan Poe elevated the gothic story, developed the unreliable narrator, recast psychological terror, and reveled in both the horror and the supernal beauty of death. From Poe’s rich, unrivaled imagination comes a collection of his most masterful works, including “The Black Cat,” “The Fall of the House of Usher,” and, of course, “The Tell-Tale Heart.” Each story explores morbid themes of grief, greed, fear, and guilt, and together they embody Poe’s grotesque obsessions—even the dread of being buried alive.

Though Joyce’s subjects were considered as taboo as his language was unsavory, Dubliners was a milestone work praised for its unflinching realism. It remains a transcendent and relatable portrait of the perils—and acceptance—of the human condition.

The Idiot (AmazonClassics Edition),"After being treated for epilepsy at a Swiss sanatorium, Prince Muishkin returns to St. Petersburg to reconnect with a wealthy distant relative and her family. Guileless and charming, Muishkin endears himself to everyone he meets, and they place him in the center of high society’s conflicts. Soon Muishkin becomes caught in a sphere of jealousy, betrayal, extortion, and murder. And he finds his loyalties divided between two women—one needing love, the other salvation.
Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s most personal work, The Idiot is an uncompromising look at a corrupt world where moral men and women are sometimes limited to immoral choices."
The Call of the Wild (AmazonClassics Edition),"In this classic American adventure, Jack London explores the laws of civilization and wilderness—and the pull of instinct—through the eyes of Buck, a half Saint Bernard, half Scottish shepherd. Stolen from his comfortable life in California, Buck is sold into service as a sled dog during the Klondike Gold Rush, where returning to his primordial nature is the only way for him to survive.
London drew on his own experiences as a prospector in the Canadian wilderness, as well as the philosophies of Charles Darwin and Friedrich Nietzsche, for this enduring tale of survival."
Andersen's Fairy Tales (AmazonClassics Edition),"Uniting universal themes with a wonderfully personal vision of the world, Hans Christian Andersen found magic in the landscape of childhood. His talking animals and living toys shine a sparkling light on the strange wisdom of innocence and the deceptive nature of adulthood. These stories have now been adapted into countless classic films (including The Little Mermaid, The Red Shoes, and Frozen—which was based on “The Snow Queen”) and have become part of our everyday speech, such as when we talk about “ugly ducklings” and “the emperor’s new clothes.”
Transcending generations, language, and nationality, these stories continue to delight and enlighten us in equal measure."
Poirot Investigates (AmazonClassics Edition),"An impossible grand theft in a posh Brighton hotel. The locked-room murder of an Italian nobleman. The suspicious suicide of a man worth more dead than alive.
What are the motives behind these puzzling crimes? In Agatha Christie’s first collection of short stories, eleven mysteries in all, detective Hercule Poirot makes his investigations. Leave it to the unflappable Belgian sleuth and his partner, Captain Arthur Hastings, to put the pieces together."
Emily of New Moon (AmazonClassics Edition),"After Emily Starr loses her dear father, the ten-year-old orphan is packed off to live with her starched relatives on Prince Edward Island. If only she could relate to them. Frankly, whip-smart, ambitious Emily can’t imagine ever feeling at home at New Moon Farm. Especially when her writerly dreams are routinely dashed by her autocratic aunt. Then Emily finds an outlet for her creative spirit with a group of friends every bit as passionate and gifted as she. With their help, New Moon could start to feel like home after all.
Lucy Maud Montgomery’s semiautobiographical coming-of-age tale is a bittersweet ode to family, friendship, and forging your own path in life."
The Tempest (AmazonClassics Edition),"For years, Prospero, sorcerer and overthrown Duke of Milan, and his daughter, Miranda, have been marooned on an island of magic, both good and evil. When a ship carrying his usurping brother sails within the realm of his power, Prospero unleashes a storm that leaves the crew washed ashore, separated, and vulnerable to his enchantments—and open to forgiveness, repentance, and love.
Given its themes of reconciliation and closure, and its references to the dissolution of “the great globe,” this tragicomedy of illusion and the supernatural is believed by some critics to be Shakespeare’s spellbinding farewell to the stage.

Leaves of Grass (AmazonClassics Edition),"Influenced by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the transcendentalist movement, Walt Whitman’s groundbreaking collection of poetry broke from the meditative traditions of the symbolic, the allegorical, and the religious. Instead, Whitman celebrated the natural world—and humanity’s individual connection with it.
In elevating the human mind, and daring to embrace the human body and its pleasures, Whitman, often called the father of free verse, composed one of the most influential and controversial works of American literature."
The Pursuit of God (AmazonClassics Edition),"A soul-searching reflection on spirituality, A. W. Tozer’s The Pursuit of God has been regarded as a classic Christian work since its publication in 1948. Tozer, a beloved, self-taught pastor, implores the reader to let go of material comforts to best cultivate a deeper spiritual life focused on the teachings of Christ. Tozer and his wife were firm practitioners of what he preached; the couple never owned a car and despite the success he found as a Christian writer, never profited greatly, as he donated much of his royalties to those in need.
Tozer’s The Pursuit of God is a spiritual meditation of timeless importance that has encouraged generations of readers to live more simply and deepen their relationships with God.

Uncle Tom's Cabin (AmazonClassics Edition),"When a Kentucky farmer is forced to sell two slaves to a plantation owner, it becomes a turning point in the lives of both slaves. For Eliza, it’s one of escape—a harrowing flight north with her young son. For Uncle Tom, sent down the Mississippi River, it’s a more certain fate, as he struggles to survive against the brutal exploitation of his traders.
As the single most popular novel of its era, Stowe’s volatile work of protest fiction fueled the abolitionist cause in the 1850s. The book personalized the plight of slavery in a way that political speeches and newspapers could not. Stowe’s humanistic approach ignited a national argument, one credited by historians as a key contributor to the outbreak of the Civil War."
Black Beauty (AmazonClassics Edition),"From the meadow of his youth to the crowded, frosty streets of London, Black Beauty tells the story of his life under many masters in Victorian England, among them the kind Squire Gordon, the principled Jeremiah Barker, and the exploitive Nicholas Skinner. No matter the circumstance, Beauty bears joy and hardship with grace, heeding his mother’s advice to be good, gentle, and hardworking—always.
At turns suspenseful, heartwarming, and heartbreaking, Black Beauty is a masterful tale promoting equality, compassion, and strength of character—and remains a treasured classic for animal lovers of all ages.

Heretics (AmazonClassics Edition),"In this 1905 collection of essays, G. K. Chesterton contests the growing intolerance for religious thinking and theological debate. He calls out friends and contemporaries—George Bernard Shaw, Rudyard Kipling, and H. G. Wells, among others—who hold divided views on art, literature, and politics but universally dismiss orthodox opinions on God and the cosmos.
As relevant today as when it was written, Heretics is a bracing challenge from one of the twentieth century’s wittiest and most influential Christian voices."
Confessions (AmazonClassics Edition),"In Confessions, regarded as the first true Western autobiography, Saint Augustine of Hippo lays bare his heart, body, and soul. In this unguarded prayer, a fallible Augustine admits to the indiscretions, selfishness, and licentious obsessions of his youth. He reveals a man of contradictory desires and beliefs, a regretful libertine torn between sin and morality on a spiritual journey toward his conversion to Christianity.
Meditative and philosophical, personal yet universal, Confessions has a surprising modernity—nearly sixteen hundred years after it was written—and still resonates, influencing and shaping our discourse on living a life filled with meaning."
The Secret of Chimneys (AmazonClassics Edition),"Cash-strapped drifter Anthony Cade agrees to two jobs at the behest of an old friend. He is to deliver an unpublished memoir to a publisher and return a cache of letters to a woman. The simple errands soon plunge Cade into dangerous international intrigue that draws together Scotland Yard, the French Sûreté, and the heir to the Herzoslovakian throne. But it’s at the historic estate of Chimneys in the English countryside that the dark secrets of a treacherous conspiracy erupt in murder.
Clandestine societies, ciphers, hidden passages, body doubles, and questionable detectives are just part of a deviously clever puzzle—part mystery, part treasure hunt—devised by the unparalleled Agatha Christie. First published in 1925, The Secret of Chimneys marked the debut of Superintendent Battle—the stolid investigator who appeared in five classic Christie mysteries."
Ethan Frome (AmazonClassics Edition),"In the dead gray cold of Starkfield, Massachusetts, farmer Ethan Frome is struggling to scrape out a living. His duties are to his wife, Zeena—an ungrateful, soul-sick hypochondriac as frigid as the New England winter. When Zeena’s cousin Mattie arrives to help with the farm, the ethereal, gentle-natured beauty brings a light and a fugitive affection into Ethan’s life. Yet for Ethan and Mattie, daring to be happy—and together—will have its consequences.
Exploring the costs of living life according to social mores, Edith Wharton’s Ethan Frome is a masterwork of doomed love.

Walden (AmazonClassics Edition),"At Walden Pond, Henry David Thoreau reflected on simpler living in the natural world. By removing himself from the distractions of materialism, Thoreau hoped to not only improve his spiritual life but also gain a better understanding of society through solitary introspection.
In Walden, Thoreau condenses his two-year, two-month, two-day stay into a single year, using the four seasons to symbolize human development—a cycle of life shared by both nature and man. A celebration of personal renewal through self-reliance, independence, and simplicity, composed for all of us living in “quiet desperation,” Walden is eternal."
A Tale of Two Cities (AmazonClassics Edition),"Charles Darnay is a French noble falsely accused of treason. Sydney Carton is a self-loathing junior barrister enlisted to defend him. Between them is a shared love for the daughter of a former Bastille prisoner. Soon, their interlocking fates will be decided, as the French Revolution is ignited and the Reign of Terror begins.
Charles Dickens’s belief in renaissance is borne out in this epic novel—as cities are overthrown and transformed, as cynics become selfless heroes, and as a “recall to life” becomes not only possible but necessary, for the individual and for society.

Lady Chatterley's Lover (AmazonClassics Edition),"When Constance Reid’s new husband, Sir Clifford Chatterley, returns from war paralyzed and in a wheelchair, she sees her future wither. As their marriage grows loveless, she mourns the desires fated to go unfulfilled. But a stirring fascination with Oliver Mellors, the estate’s coarse, taciturn gamekeeper, blooms into feelings she feared had died. Soon the lovers find themselves entangled in scandal, and their taboo affair becomes as pernicious as it is passionate.
Condemned when first published for its frank language and bold eroticism, this controversial landmark novel stands today as a trailblazing contribution to the literary canon.

Before he sets sail, the beloved prophet is asked by his followers to impart his truth. In these twenty-eight poetic essays, he offers profound inspiration on such matters of love and friendship, freedom and self-knowledge, joy and sorrow, pleasure, prayer, and death. In doing so, Almustafa offers a universal serenity.
A Lebanese émigré to the United States, Kahlil Gibran wrote The Prophet to transcend the barriers between East and West and to open up new possibilities for spiritual guidance. Today it stands as one of the most beloved and translated books in history."
The War of the Worlds (AmazonClassics Edition),"A metallic cylinder falls to earth, landing in the sands of Horsell Common, Surrey, generating curiosity and awe. But what’s inside soon induces only terror. The story that unfolds is a breathless first-person account of an inconceivable reality: an extraterrestrial war has been waged on the planet.
In a twist on cautionary turn-of-the-century invasion literature, H. G. Wells posits the Martian attack as an insurmountable apocalyptic event. The first of its kind and a foundational work, The War of the Worlds inspired a radio broadcast, television shows, graphic novels, and countless films; roused the imagination and stirred anxieties; and changed the landscape of science fiction for generations.

Darkness There: Selected Tales by Edgar Allan Poe [Kindle in Motion],"Edgar Allan Poe is known as the forefather of suspense and modern crime fiction. For the first time ever, Darkness There showcases some of his most famous tales with stunning digital illustrations. Each story explores a different twist of madness, murder, and melancholy, from the horror of being buried alive in “The Fall of the House of Usher” to the desperate case of two gruesome killings in “The Murders in the Rue Morgue.” The heartbeat of paranoia in “The Tell-Tale Heart,” the razor-sharp claustrophobia in “The Pit and the Pendulum,” and a mourner’s torment in “The Raven” reveal—and revel in—life’s creepiest and craziest. These tales are not for the faint of heart or the thin of skin."
Beowulf (AmazonClassics Edition),"The great drinking hall, Heorot, provides merriment for warriors and wenches alike. But it provokes only avenging rage from swamp creature Grendel.

As a Man Thinketh (AmazonClassics Edition),"“As you dream,” philosopher and poet James Allen wrote, “so shall you become.” First published in 1903, this seminal self-help classic laid the foundation for today’s mindfulness practices and teachings. One of the first to explore the power of positive thought, Allen illuminated its effect on character, circumstance, health and body, purpose, achievement, ideals, and serenity. The root of Allen’s beliefs? That success, personal fulfillment, and inner peace really are all in your mind.
Revolutionary and enduring, the practical, profound, and simple meditations in this groundbreaking work still resonate after more than a century, and they have established its author as the father of the New Thought movement."
The Age of Innocence (AmazonClassics Edition),"It’s the perfect match—gentleman lawyer Newland Archer will marry young socialite May Welland. The marriage should be a source of pride for Newland, accustomed as he is to meeting the expectations of New York’s high society. But when he falls for May’s exotic and enchanting cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska, he faces an impossible choice: should he be the dutiful husband and stay with his bride, or give in to his passions and follow the countess around the world?
A classic that encapsulates the etiquette of the times, The Age of Innocence is as much about loyalty, duty, and decorum as it is about desire."
Through the Looking-Glass (AmazonClassics Edition),"When Alice steps through a mirror, she enters a reflection of her world where backwards is forwards, the future is remembered, and only the opposite of logic makes sense. Increasingly befuddled, she’s challenged by the belligerent Humpty Dumpty, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the nonsense rhymes of the Jabberwocky, and the discovery that she’s a pawn in a living game of chess. To become queen and find her way home, Alice must play.
A masterpiece of the absurd, Lewis Carroll’s sequel to Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland continues to inspire artists, filmmakers, musicians, and writers after all these years."

Southern Horrors & The Red Record (AmazonClassics Edition),"In the United States at the turn of the nineteenth century, crusading African American journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett bravely reported on the scourge of white supremacist violence that had personally impacted her own life and work. Her reporting exposed and riled the South, enlightened uninformed Northerners, and captured international attention.
Southern Horrors and The Red Record offer extensive accounts of the lynching, cruelty, and hate that African Americans faced in the early years of the Jim Crow South. Unafraid of the opposition, she also delved into the social, sexual, and political oppression of women as no one had before. This progressive and courageous work made her the most famous Black woman in the country. With an incredible prescience and a frank, clear-eyed tone, Wells-Barnett’s outrage—often indicated by the simple enumeration of names, dates, and statistics—resonates just as powerfully now as it did then. Her call for justice is a call that we still need to hear."
Candide (AmazonClassics Edition),"Candide, the illegitimate nephew of a German baron and student of eternal optimist Pangloss, is living a simple and sheltered life in “the best of all possible worlds.”
But when Candide falls in love with the wrong woman, his uncle’s young daughter, he is exiled from the baron’s castle and suffers great tragedy and catastrophe, which leaves him disillusioned and questioning the goodness of the universe.
Penned in just three days—and published in secret because of its blasphemous and seditious nature—Voltaire’s legendary satire deftly skewers religious, romantic, and political naïveté with an acerbic and ribald wit that delights to this day."
The Importance of Being Earnest (AmazonClassics Edition),"Friends Jack Worthing and Algernon Moncrieff often need an escape from their burdensome social obligations. So Jack, who goes by Ernest in London, lives a double life, while Algy has invented an alibi: a best friend named Bumbury who is perpetually on his deathbed.
But as Jack and Algy set about wooing the objects of their affection, the inevitable unraveling of the men’s duplicity and deception threatens their happily ever afters.
In his exhilarating and subversive comedy of bizarre coincidence, disguise, and ribald misadventure, Oscar Wilde takes delight in cracking the facade that defined the civility and high-minded manners of Victorian society."
"The Man Who Was Thursday, A Nightmare (AmazonClassics Edition)","Poet Gabriel Syme believes in the beauty of order and, as such, is recruited by Scotland Yard to an anti-anarchist police corp. While undercover, Syme meets fellow poet Lucian Gregory, a verse writer devoted to disorder, who introduces him to London’s anarchist underworld. Just as Gregory is to be elected to the central council, Syme’s cover is revealed and he is forced to make a decision that sends the cabal into chaos. Is anyone in this underground faction who or what they seem? Syme suddenly realizes he doesn’t have all the answers.
G. K. Chesterton’s masterpiece unfolds itself as a marvel of disguises: political parable, detective novel, Edwardian gothic, spy thriller, and metaphysical mystery—a byzantine maze of deception and subterfuge that surprises to this day."
To the Lighthouse (AmazonClassics Edition),"On the glistening surface of Virginia Woolf’s groundbreaking novel is the Ramsay family, a seemingly stable group of characters, but a group that is ultimately subject to the same alterations and losses that come with the passing of time. Set at the Ramsays’ summerhouse over two September days, ten years apart, Woolf’s influential landmark of twentieth-century literature explores the hopes, frustrations, and small moments of grace and change that permeate everyday life. First published in 1927, To the Lighthouse provides a quintessentially modernist, kaleidoscopic focus on the characters’ interior lives, but it also offers an enduringly wise and sensitive portrayal of human fragility. In Woolf’s novel, the absurdity, mundanity, and tenuousness of human life is uniquely evident—and uniquely beautiful as a result."
The Conjure Woman (AmazonClassics Edition),"A northern white couple has relocated to the South to operate a vineyard on a North Carolina plantation. There, they pass their idle hours listening to the stories of one Uncle Julius, who has a deep knowledge of the land. These stories, however, are more than mere entertainments. They all have their time and place, and they offer not only a quiet commentary on the events of the day but also a deeper reckoning with the plantation’s disturbing past.
First published in 1899, this collection of stories introduced Charles W. Chesnutt to the public as a spinner of fantastical conjure tales. Exploring Southern folklore and supernaturalism and offering a subversive challenge to white authority, they are now regarded as preeminent works of African American literature."
Tristram Shandy (AmazonClassics Edition),"Beginning with the events leading up to his conception, Tristram Shandy intends to grace readers with his remarkable life story. But his words often run wild. And through two expansive arcs—marvels of incident—so does his narrative, chockablock with family, friends, chambermaids, midwives, parsons, guardians, and neighbors. For the defensive Tristram, marshaling his material becomes something of a wonderful struggle with every new digression.
Defiantly original, deliberately playful, and an absurd celebration of writing, Tristram Shandy’s progressive experimental structure divided critics, delighted readers, and exerted an influence on generations of writers. Today, Laurence Sterne’s tour de force is universally lauded as a milestone in metafictional narrative."
The Pickwick Papers (AmazonClassics Edition),"Samuel Pickwick, founder and chairman of the Pickwick Club, engages three fellow members to accompany him on a journey. By coach they’ll travel to the outreaches of London to explore, observe, and report back on the quaint wonders of the English countryside. What transpires is a picaresque romp of misadventures, hair-raising challenges, and romantic follies entangling the fates of a riot of colorful characters—a passel of villains, spinsters, poets, and sportsmen—and the unworldly Pickwick himself, who has much to learn about life outside his gentleman’s club.
At once a slapstick farce and whip-smart social satire, Charles Dickens’s debut was a publishing phenomenon that catapulted its author into inimitable fame."
Darkwater: Voices from within the Veil (AmazonClassics Edition),"In this ambitious—even radical—literary collection, first published in 1920, civil rights leader W. E. B. Du Bois tackled race, gender, art, politics, labor, and economics from the perspective of an African American who, in his own words, had “been in the world, but not of it.”
Du Bois took an experimental approach in Darkwater—utilizing essays, poetry, spirituals, sketches, and autobiographical writings—to break new ground on issues of race, class, and prejudice that continue to confound us. These are deep meditations, based on years of introspection and observation, but their cumulative effect goes beyond mere philosophy: it builds to a clear demand for justice and equality. Du Bois was a leading thinker on these questions throughout his life, but Darkwater stands as one of his most expansive and prophetic calls to action."
The Complete Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar (AmazonClassics Edition),"The first African American poet to achieve international fame, Paul Laurence Dunbar used his prodigious literary gifts to chronicle and celebrate Black life as he saw it. He utilized both traditional poetic forms and contemporary dialect in a range of styles—lyrical, conversational, and playful—as diverse as his themes. This collection, containing the entirety of Dunbar’s poetry, captures his still vital expressions of love, work, and family. It also serves as a revelatory expression of Dunbar’s frustrations with racial injustice and oppression.
Joyous, mournful, firmly grounded, yet transcendent, Dunbar’s inventive work has been cited as a major influence by many contemporary poets."
Cane (AmazonClassics Edition),"A striking mosaic of prose, poetry, and dramatic dialogue, Jean Toomer’s Cane has come to be considered a masterpiece of the Harlem Renaissance. Structured as a series of vignettes ripe with longing, passion, violence, and revenge, the haunting novel gives a powerful voice to the interior lives of African Americans in the rural South and urban North.
Championed for its unsparing honesty and psychological insight by such luminaries as Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, Alice Walker, and Maya Angelou, Cane shines as a beacon to generations of African American writers who followed."
